        <h1>Projecting The Impact of the Rockets' Rookies From The 2022 NBA Draft Next Season</h1>
        <p>Back in June, the NBA Draft saw the Rockets take home 3 promising prospects in Jabari Smith Jr, Tari Eason, and TyTy Washington Jr at picks 3,17, and 29, respectively. In Summer League, each displayed their abilities and what they can hopefully add team next season. They are coming into a situation that is meant for the young players to grow and develop, with the Houston Rockets. However, because of a limited number of minutes available and so many rookie and sophomore members set to be a part of the team next season, it becomes difficult for everyone to get the opportunity to perform that they probably deserve.</p>
        <p>This leads us to the fact that each of the Rockets’ 2022 draft selections will need to fill a unique role that may differ from their collegiate careers. The team currently has 9 players on the roster that have less than 2 years of experience in the NBA and a good majority have loads of untapped potential. This forces the organization to pick between players like Daishen Nix and TyTy Washington as well as Tari Eason and Kenyon Martin for who will receive real minutes this upcoming year. These implications make it more difficult to determine what kind of effect the incoming rookies will have on the team compared to last season where there were more minutes to go around.</p>
        <p>Future moves will also have an influence on the predictions that follow. For example, in the case that Eric Gordon is traded before the start of the season, the starting small forward position would open up and may be filled by Tari Eason. Another possibility is that somebody starts the season off slow and loses their spot to TyTy Washington. The fact that Eason and Washington are also a year older than the Rockets’ 4 first round picks from last season, further complicates the circumstances. It is easy for the Rockets to send 19-year-old rookies down to the G-league, but maybe it becomes more difficult to justify when someone like Tari Eason is already 21. What follows is what I believe the role will be of each of the Rockets’ players from the 2022 NBA Draft as well as their projected statistics from my perspective.</p>
        <h2>Jabari Smith Jr.</h2>
        <h4>Probable Role: Starting Power Forward (23-30 minutes per game)</h4>
        <h4>Projected Stats Per Game (2022-2023 season): 15.7 points, 9.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.2 blocks</h4>
        <p>Being the consensus #1 pick, up until draft night, Smith will have the most responsibility next season of the 3. Almost certainly, he will be inserted into the starting front court alongside Alperen Sengun and will play as the second or third option on the team. His shooting and defense will be a crucial part of the Rockets system and the fact that he can play multiple positions will open up the floor even more. He is exactly the type of player that they desperately needed last year and considering that he is supposed to be a main part of the long-term future, Smith will likely get plenty of burn at the NBA level while posting impressive numbers.</p>
        <h2>Tari Eason</h2>
        <h4>Probable Role: Backup Wing (13-18 minutes per game) </h4>
        <h4>Projected Stats Per Game (2022-2023 season): 10.7 points, 7.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 1.1 steals, 0.6 blocks</h4>
        <p>Tari Eason is the first tangible piece to come from the haul of draft picks that the Rockets received in the James Harden trade that sent him to Brooklyn, and fans should be very excited. He was named to the All-Summer League First Team as he showed out and somewhat outplayed Jabari Smith. I predict that Eason will start off the season on the bench but may have a chance to become a starter if Eric Gordon is traded. So far, Eason has exceeded expectations and shown that he is a quality 3 and D wing with the ability to create off the dribble. Who knows, maybe he will become the solidified 5th starter by the end of the year.</p>
        <h2>TyTy Washington</h2>
        <h4>Probable Role: Star on the G-league Vipers (30 minutes per game)</h4>
        <h4>Projected Stats Per Game (2022-2023 G-league season): 18.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.3 steals, 0.4 blocks</h4>
        <p>Right now, Washington is in direct competition with Daishen Nix for the team’s backup point guard position and so far, I think Nix is winning. This means Washington will be relegated to the G-league Vipers to fill a similar position as Nix did last season. It could be a good move for both him and the Rockets because Washington gets a significant amount of minutes and experience while not taking up a rotation spot. The organization implemented a similar strategy with Usman Garuba and Josh Christopher last season, and it would make the most sense for them to do it again here. Unfortunately, his future with the team is somewhat unclear, due to the Rockets simply having too many players, but he should and will take every opportunity to prove his worth next year.</p>
        <p>Too many young talents and not enough playing time seems to be a main problem next season for the Rockets, but that is a good problem to have. This season is a way for everyone to display their skillset and help answer the question of who will be on the roster moving forward. All 3 rookies have something to prove, and I am excited to watch it unfold. One thing for sure is that the organization is building a promising, young core and is on the path to success in the future. The biggest issue between now and then is trying to figure out who deserves to be on the eventual championship-caliber team.</p>
