        <h1>2022-2023 Tankathon Update, Predictions, and How It All Affects the Rockets</h1>
        <p>This NBA season has gotten off to a surprising start, to say the least. We’ve seen internal collapses for teams that were once considered powerhouses like the Warriors, Lakers, and Nets, along with other organizations that have performed surprisingly well like the Trailblazers, Cavaliers, and, to an extent, the Washington Wizards. The first month of the season has shown us why sports are incredibly unpredictable. Among the teams that have been surprising are the Utah Jazz, Indiana Pacers, OKC Thunder, and San Antonio Spurs. All of these franchisees were supposed to participate in the “race to the bottom” of the league in hopes of landing top prospect Victor Wembenyama. Now that some of them appear not to be going all-in on losing games, what does that mean for the Rockets’ chances at the #1 overall pick?</p>
        <h2>Contenders: Jazz, Trailblazers</h2>
        <p>“Contenders” for this section does not mean I think these teams have a chance to win the championship, but rather that they have the potential to be contending for post-season seeding. It may be a bit of an overreaction to suggest the Jazz can maintain their current win percentage of 71% (at the time of writing, same for all others), but you cannot tell me they will just decide to give up on this season when they are currently the #1 seed in the Western Conference. They may not have much of a chance come playoff time, but there’s uncertainty in that statement based on what we’ve seen so far. In the case of the Trailblazers, they definitely aren’t going to tank this season. It makes no sense for them to waste another year of Damian Lillard’s career for a future star that doesn’t fit the timeline. Unless they trade Dame, don’t expect the Trailblazers to be in the lottery.</p>
        <h2>Pretenders: Spurs, Thunder, Pacers</h2>
        <p>The Spurs, Thunder, and Pacers have all started off hot, but I don’t see their success continuing. The Spurs basically have no star players in a star-oriented league. They just snapped a 5-game losing streak, which already shows them coming back down to reality. Sorry Spurs’ fans, but this year just isn’t your year. Tanking for a top 5 pick is your best option. The same goes for the Thunder and the Pacers, but both do have somewhat of a star in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton, respectively. However, these guys can only do so much, as they aren't all-nba or even all-star type players. The Thunder just ended a losing streak as well and I predict the Pacers to go on one soon. The Thunder’s roster isn’t built to win now, and it feels like the Pacers are on the verge of trading some of their key players for future assets. All 3 of these teams are likely going to end up near the bottom of the league.</p>
        <h2>Tankers: Rockets, Pistons, Magic</h2>
        <p>Now we have the organizations that were projected to be terrible, and have been living up to their expectations. The only bright spot for the Magic has been Paolo Banchero, and other than him, have been atrocious to watch. That was what we thought was going to happen. Banchero needs another young guy on the roster to develop alongside him, so trying to win now just doesn’t make any sense for them. The Pistons are in a similar situation, except they already do have 2 top prospects in Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey. It’s tough to compete without mortgaging your future because the NBA as a whole is so stacked right now, and that’s the problem the Pistons are facing. They have talent, yes, but no experience to back it up. My prediction is they’re trying to wait it out for 1 more season before deciding to push for wins. The Rockets are also doing the same thing, waiting for 1 more season before trying to compete. There’s zero logic behind any of these organizations going all in now, so, as a result, all were supposed to be terrible and have fulfilled that prediction.</p>
        <h2>What It Means For the Rockets</h2>
        <p>I would say the Rockets’ chance at being the worst team in the league has improved, but their chance of getting Victor Wembenyama has stayed the same. We already assumed the organization was going to be bottom 3 in the league, giving them a 14% chance at the #1 overall pick, so that hasn’t been affected by these other teams. What has been affected, though, is their competition for being the absolute worst. With the Jazz, Spurs, Thunder, and Pacers off to a good start, if they win at the same pace as the Rockets for the rest of the season, the Rockets will end up having a worse record. This gives us a buffer to win a certain number of games without losing lottery odds. We still have to be careful, with the Pistons and Magic right there with us, but all of the losing we have done now is going to pay off later in the season. No team is ever going to go 0-82, at least not anytime soon, so you have to keep the games fun and interesting to encourage ticket sales while not winning too many games. That’s a tough balance to have, and the Rockets have done a fairly good job of that. Time will tell, but I’m pleased to see some of our competition in securing the worst record are winning games.</p>
