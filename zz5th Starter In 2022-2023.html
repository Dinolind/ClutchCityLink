        <h1>Analyzing Who Should Be the Rockets' 5th Starter This Upcoming Season</h1>
        <p>One of the biggest questions left to be answered by the Houston Rockets before the start of next season is who will be the 5th starter alongside, most likely, Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr, and Alperen Sengun. With no moves made in the offseason that solidified this role for anybody, it remains up in the air. Several candidates are worthy of this position for different reasons, and it is tricky to choose the best option for both now and the future. Among them are Eric Gordon, Tari Eason, Kenyon Martin Jr, and Jae’Sean Tate. They’re only a certain number of minutes in an NBA game and it is crucial for the Rockets to use them wisely.</p>
        <p>This decision is not as simple as picking the best player. Aspects like age, fit, and reliability also play a factor. The person needs to be able to space the floor around Sengun and be quick enough to keep up with the pace of the offense.  Preferably, the selected teammate would play good defense in the crunch time minutes and rebound the ball at a decent volume. This role also could change throughout the season. Maybe as one of the young guys progresses, they become the most deserving. It also comes down to individual matchups on any given night. Stephen Silas may choose the 5th starter that best counters the opposing team, which could vary from game to game.</p>
        <p>The first two people to rule out would be Garrison Matthews and Kenyon Martin jr. Although last year both played big roles on the team, those days are over. Matthews is a shooter, but that's pretty much it. The Rockets signed him to a team-friendly, 4 year/$8,200,000 contract last season, which, to put it bluntly, isn’t NBA-starter type money. Martin, on the other hand, recently requested a trade for fear of potentially not receiving enough minutes next season, and if even he doesn’t believe he will be the starter, why should we. With Martin and Matthews eliminated, below are the pros and cons of starting each of the remaining three this upcoming season.</p>
        <h2>Eric Gordon</h2>
        <p>On paper, Eric Gordon is not only the best player out of the 3, but arguably the best player on the entire team. Gordon could help the team win more games, if that is the goal next season, and mentor other young guards like KPJ and Jalen Green. However, he is currently the oldest member on the roster aside from Boban Marjonovic, and is rumored to be traded very soon. The former 6th Man of the Year is the last remaining piece from the “James Harden Era” and many believe he is best suited elsewhere. Another issue is that his natural position is at shooting guard and that role is strongly solidified by Jalen Green. Last year we saw three guard lineups work at times, but that is not the best option for your consistent starting lineup because other teams will learn how to plan against it.</p>
        <h2>Tari Eason</h2>
        <p>First off, Eason is the youngest of the 3 and probably has the most potential. It may be more beneficial to the Rockets in the long run to give him those minutes to help his development. Unlike Gordon, Eason is more likely to be a part of the long-term future and having him build chemistry now with the other starters may be valuable in the future. So far, he has impressed in Summer League and looks poised to outplay some guys picked ahead of him. Eason looks like a solid 3 and D wing who has the ability to create off the dribble and rebound effectively. Despite that, he is the most inexperienced at the NBA level out of the three, and is not currently the all-around best player. The 17th overall pick might also struggle to get touches in the starting lineup and may serve better as a key player off the bench.</p>
        <h2>Jae’Sean Tate</h2>
        <p>Many have labeled Jae’Sean Tate as the new PJ Tucker for this Rockets team, and deservedly so. Over 2 seasons, he has averaged 11.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game while being one of the best defenders on the team. Tate is one of those players that doesn’t jump off the stat sheet but does everything you would want him to do. He hustles, takes charges, and is the backbone of the defense. Unfortunately, those things may not be as valuable this upcoming season. Gordon has the ability to score while playing great defense, and Eason is known for being a high-energy guy who does whatever it takes to win. Other additions like Jabari Smith Jr. and Usman Garuba also make it easier to justify taking Tate out of the starting lineup. Furthermore, his inability to shoot the ball may hinder the number of minutes he receives next season.</p>
        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>Gordon should have the spot locked down for now. You simply don’t pay arguably your best player $20 million to come off the bench. But, he has been in trade rumors for some time now and clearly won’t be on the team past his current contract. In the event that a trade does occur, it really becomes a toss-up between the other two. If Eason comes out of the gate on fire and slowly progresses throughout the season, he is likely to earn that spot. On the other hand, if the Rockets perform terribly without Tate’s presence on the floor, naming him the starting small forward wouldn’t be too unlikely. For now this question remains unanswered, and I believe it will stay that way for a while, barring some unforeseen circumstances. Sadly, tough decisions, like this, must be made in pursuit of winning an NBA championship.</p>
