        <h1>3 Eric Gordon Trades That Actually Make Sense In 2022 Following The NBA Draft</h1>
        <p>Almost 3 years later, Eric Gordon still remains on the Rockets as the last domino to fall in the post James Harden era. It has become obvious that while Eric Gordon provides a valuable skillset to the team, due to his age, he is not meant for the long-term future. So, the question is, “Why hasn’t he been traded yet?” The answer to that is a multitude of reasons such as Gordon’s veteran presence being beneficial to other young players, the Rockets not getting fair value in return through a trade, and his undesirable contract.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the fact is that Gordon is extremely unlikely to be on the team after next season. Whether he gets traded in the coming days or it is pushed off until next offseason, he is going to be moved sooner rather than later. As of now, there have been several teams rumored to have interest in acquiring Eric Gordon such as the Heat, Bucks, Suns, Lakers, and Sixers, but in some cases, it is hard to make the money work.</p>
        <p>Part of what makes a supposed trade so difficult is that Gordon is owed nearly 20 million dollars next season, and any of the young players the Rockets hope to get in return are on small contracts in comparison. The Rockets also don’t want to take back any long-term deals in the transaction as an effort to preserve their cap space in the 2023 offseason. Furthermore, it only makes sense trading him to a contending team which limits the potential options even more.</p>
        <p>Although Gordon has been incredibly valuable to the franchise over the past 6 years including earning the 6th man of the year award in 2017 and being an integral part of those championship caliber years with Chris Paul and James Harden, I believe it is time for both parties to move on. Gordon needs to seek out the opportunity to win a championship and the Rockets need to recoup assets while they still can. Those are the main goals of the trades that follow. To have a great ending to what has been an amazing story.</p>
        <h2>Trade #1</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Tobias Harris, 2024 1st round pick via Philadelpha (Unprotected), 2026 1st round pick via Philadelpha (Top 8 Protected)</h4>
        <h4>Sixers receive: Eric Gordon, Dennis Schroder (Sign-and-trade), David Nwaba</h4>
        <p>Yes, the Rockets are trading a bad contract for a worse one by receiving Tobias Harris but are getting two first picks to compensate. Dennis Schroder and David Nwaba likely weren’t going to be rotational pieces for the team next season anyways, so getting value for them is a bonus. The Rockets would likely buy out Harris after or during next season to retain their cap space and potentially use the picks acquired in a future trade. In the meantime, Harris provides the franchise with an additional wing player to insert into the starting lineup. What’s more is that the Rockets have expressed that they want draft capital far in the future for Gordon and this trade certainly accomplishes that. Lastly, Eric Gordon gets to reunite with Harden, PJ Tucker, and Danuel House as Daryl Moorey continues to build the “Philadelphia Rockets.”</p>
        <p>From the Sixers perspective, Gordon provides them with another shot-creator alongside Harden and Embiid, which increases the organization’s chances at a championship. Harden isn’t getting any younger so the time to go all in may be now. The Sixers also gain some cap flexibility with this move as they get out of paying Harris’s huge contract. The pick in 2024 is likely a mid to late first round selection and the one in 2026 is top 8 protected. Not too bad for their long-term future. Matisse Thybulle is another candidate to be considered in a trade like this, but including him makes it even harder for the money to match. Overall, Philly gets a win-now player and Houston gets assets to help them build towards the future.</p>
        <h2>Trade #2</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Dario Saric, Torrey Craig, Josh Okogie, 2023 1st round pick via Phoenix (Top 10 Protected), 2024 2nd round pick via Phoenix (Unprotected)</h4>
        <h4>Suns receive: Eric Gordon</h4>
        <p>The rockets take a flyer on Dario Saric who has been injured for quite some time and get two other solid players who are also on expiring contracts in Torrey Craig and Josh Okogie. Getting 3 expiring contracts, a 1st and a 2nd seems like a decent return for Eric Gordon. However, this trade will create some competition for who makes the roster considering the other players the Rockets received in the Christian Wood trade, but competition often forces some players to play better. Who knows? Maybe Saric or Okogie will turn out to be a stud and looking back, this trade will seem like a steal.</p>
        <p>The Suns get to further bolster their championship quality roster by adding another threat to score the basketball. Gordon would also compliment the suns defense and be a good locker room presence with some playoff experience. The 2023 first isn’t too valuable and the 2024 2nd, is well, just a second. Although Saric may have contributed to the Suns next season, his impact is nothing compared to what Gordon’s can be. The Suns get a win-now player without giving up too many assets, and maybe there is still some chemistry between Gordon and Chris Paul that may help the team become NBA champions.</p>
        <h2>Trade #3</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Derrick Favors, Kendrick Nunn, 2024 1st round pick via Houston from OKC (Lottery Protected), 2023 2nd round pick via Chicago from Los Angeles (Unprotected), 2023 2nd round pick via Los Angeles (Unprotected)</h4>
        <h4>Lakers receive: Eric Gordon</h4>
        <h4>Thunder receive: Talen Horton-Tucker, Max Christle</h4>
        <p>I know this trade seems like a lot to take in but hear me out. First off, the Rockets get Derrick Favors on an expiring contract to play backup center behind Sengun providing a much-needed defensive big man to the roster. They also get Kendrick Nunn to fill the void left by Dennis Schroder for a year before deciding if he is worth keeping around. On top of that, they get back some of the draft rights to their 2024 1st round pick sent to the Thunder in the Russell Westbrook trade and two additional seconds. Getting multiple draft picks and no long-term contracts in return is a great deal for Eric Gordon.  </p>
        <p>The Lakers get to run it back with some additional shooting and defense added to their lineup while not having to give up a 1st round pick. Lebron is entering the final year of his contract and the team needs to do something to increase their odds of winning next season. While THT may have some potential, Gordon helps them more in the short-term next season. The Lakers need to strive to be competitive, since most of their draft assets are owed to other teams, and this trade helps them accomplish that.</p>
        <p>OKC gets a promising young player in THT without having to give up too much. The Rockets will likely still be in the lottery by the 2024 NBA draft, so the Thunder have a high chance of retaining that pick. They have also been eager to trade Favors, and this is the perfect opportunity. Max Christle is just salary filler but may turn out to be something in the future. This is a low-risk, high-reward scenario for the organization so why not take it.</p>
        <p>Whether it's one of these trades or something completely different, the Eric Gordon situation will be solved relatively soon. The time is now to get maximum value for Eric Gordon while the Rockets still can.</p>
