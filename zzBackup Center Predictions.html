        <h1>Why Do the Rockets Have 5 Centers? (And Who's Going to Be the Backup Next Season)</h1>
        <p>As you may know, Bruno Fernando was recently converted from a two-way contract to a standard one worth about $11 million. With this signing, the Rockets officially have 5 centers on their active roster: Fernando, Usman Garuba, Alperen Sengun, Boban Marjanovic, and Derrick Favors. Typically, NBA teams stick to just 2 or 3  guys at each position, so you may be wondering why Houston has chosen to allocate 5 of its 15 roster spots to big men. It has in part to do with the variety of skill sets among them, and I’m here to break down piece by piece what each of the players hopes to offer this season. This will help give a clearer picture of who fill in for Sengun when he gets some rest.</p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun</h2>
        <p>Alpi is going to be the consistent starter, barring an injury or major changes, and certainly earned that spot last season. He is like a baby Nikola Jokic, who is an excellent facilitator, scorer, and regular MVP candidate. Not saying Sengun is anywhere close to that level now, but he is only 20 years old, and seems to be heading in the right direction. Many people describe his game as magical, which it is, when you watch him play. Some of the passes he makes on a regular basis simply make the defense look silly. He’s a one of a kind type guy, and could be the labled as the biggest steal from the 2021 NBA draft a few years down the road.</p>
        <h2>Bruno Fernando</h2>
        <p>The guy that inspired this article, Bruno Fernando, has been very impressive during the first couple games of preseason. His athleticism is off the charts, and his ability to block shots is exceptional for someone that’s only 6’9”, which is relatively small for an NBA center. Additionally, he looks like he fits in very well on offense as someone who can push the pace and hold his own in the paint. Fernando has blossomed with the Rockets, which is good for him and the organization long term. If he can keep up his play, I don’t see why he can’t beat out Garuba and Marjanovic for the backup spot. He is a diamond in the rough that shouldn’t be overlooked </p>
        <h2>Boban Marjanovic</h2>
        <p>Boban is known as one of the greatest locker room guys all around the league, and for good reason. I mean how can you not like Boban. He is a freak of nature standing at a staggering 7’4”, and looks like a man among boys on the court. I don’t know how much he’ll play next season, but he is still a good guy for the team to hold on to. If there’s ever a situation where they need a rebound or somebody to guard the inbounder on the opposing team, then Marjanovic is the perfect fit. I don’t think we’ll see him get consistent minutes, but he could fit in really well under specific circumstances, and be a good teammate outside of just basketball.</p>
        <h2>Usman Garuba</h2>
        <p>Garuba’s rookie year wasn't great to say the least, but he hopes to turn that around. He and Josh Christopher were picked at #23 and #24 respectively in the 2021 NBA draft, and to this point, Christopher has been the better of the two in the NBA. Garuba has had success overseas, though, recently winning the Eurobasket championship with Spain while being a key member. He is an exceptional defender that can rebound, but hasn’t developed much of an offense game to this point. If you could somehow merge the skill sets of Fernando and him into 1 person, then the Rockets would have one of the best backup, if not starting, centers in the entire league. Before Fernando was signed, Garuba seemed to have this spot locked down, but now it’s up in the air.</p>
        <h2>Derrick Favors</h2>
        <p>Derrick Favors is the newest member of the center rotation in Houston, but has the most experience playing in the NBA of all of them. He was with the Utah Jazz from 2011-2019, and has bounced around from team to team ever since. I don’t know exactly how much longer he’ll be a part of the organization, but my guess is that we won’t see him in Houston through the end of the season. He did get some minutes in the preseason game against the Raptors a few nights ago, which gave us a glimpse at what he can do. I thought he wouldn’t see the floor at all, but I guess the coaching staff decided that they’re paying him to be there, so they might as well use him. Unfortunately, he just doesn’t fit the timeline of what the Rockets are trying to do, so it’s tough for me to say he could end up being the guy behind Sengun.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Having 5 people that can play center on a single roster just isn’t going to last. I expect one of these guys to be gone by the first game of the season when it comes time for the Rockets to cut their team down to just 15 players. Sadly, I think Favors will be the one to go. The other 4 just provide more value to the franchise as a whole. I also expect the backup center spot to fluctuate a lot throughout the season. Sengun is going to be the starter, there’s no doubt about it, but each of the other guys have very different skill sets. If I had to pick, I would say Bruno Fernando is going to be the player that most consistently gets minutes when Sengun is on the bench. They didn’t give him a 4 year contract if they weren’t going to play him. However, I still hope Garuba is given a chance to prove himself, which I’m sure will happen.
