        <h1>3 Trade Pieces Who Could Soon Be On the Move (Besides Gordon and Martin)</h1>
        <p>Trade season is now upon us. While no moves have been made just yet, as of me writing this article, it doesn’t mean stuff isn’t about to start happening. For the Houston Rockets, two main players have been labeled as potential pieces in a transaction: Eric Gordon and Kenyon Martin Jr. However, it isn’t all that simple. The Rockets are a rebuilding team, and, as such, should be willing to listen to any and all offers for everybody on the roster. I’ve already made a list for 3 players who might have their time in Houston cut short, which you can check out <a href="zz3 Trade Pieces Who Could Be On the Move.html">here</a>, but the following are my picks for assets that could be moved in the near future. As a result there will be some overlap, but I am not including any duplicates here. So beyond the obvious of the 2 names mentioned above, here are some other guys who could be exchanged before the deadline passes.</p>
        <h2>Josh Christopher</h2>
        <p>Josh Christopher has an interesting story. From someone who rose in the draft and lived up to the hype with an outstanding rookie season, to someone who has struggled finding minutes recently. It’s not really his fault, though. In fact, he has been somewhat impressive when he is out on the court, but doesn’t seem to have improved much since last year. Maybe when Eric Gordon is finally traded, more opportunities will open up in the guard rotation. For now, though, there’s just too much competition with himself, Daishen Nix, KPJ, Jalen Green, Tyty Washington Jr., Garrison Mathews, and Gordon all being worthy of consistent run out on the floor.</p>
        <p>One good thing is that the Arizona State guard has been absolutely outstanding in the g-league. In his first 2 games, Christopher averaged 28.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 8 assists, 1 block, and 1 steal per night in about 34 minutes. The guard has proved that he is still a quality player, and some team out there may offer a late first rounder for his skill set. In that position, I’m not sure exactly what the organization would do. I think at least 1, if not 2, guards must be traded over the next couple months. Christopher is the person who has been cut from the lineup on most nights in favor of others, and could seek to go somewhere else, promising him a bigger role.</p>
        <h2>Bruno Fernando</h2>
        <p>I think it’s become the consensus among fans that Bruno Fernando needs to start getting playing time over Usman Garuba. If I am accurate in that conclusion, then, naturally, Fernando needs to find a new franchise to play for. He’s a lob threat who also blocks shots and can probably play well off of a ball-dominant point guard. Think like James Harden and Clint Capela near the beginning of their partnership. The problem is we don’t really have a need for that type of guy in Houston with Alperens Sengun’s offense and Garuba’s defense. Both of those centers are more important than Bruno Fernando to the future in Houston.</p>
        <p>The first hurdle is that Fernando can’t be traded until January 1, 2023 at the very earliest because he signed a contract less than 3 months ago. The next issue is assessing the proper value to assign. Unfortunately, that number isn’t very high. Rim-running bigs are easy to come by, and are, therefore, not worth very much. Maybe some other organization would swap a low-tier wing or a second round pick, but that’s about it. At some point, it’s not even worth the effort. The ultimate solution may be just benching him rather than shipping him away. I’m just worried that if Stephen Silas has that option to go to in a close game, he just may do it because of Fernando’s chemistry with Kevin Porter Jr.</p>
        <h2>Garrison Mathews</h2>
        <p>Garrison Mathews is stuck in a similar situation to Josh Christopher. He is a shooter, who is usually very dependent on momentum, but is unable to secure consistent minutes with the Houston Rockets. As much as we like him in Houston, I could see a potential transaction on the horizon, maybe as a throw-in piece to make the money match. I just don't see him being worth very much on his own. This is definitely the player I feel the least confident about being traded because of how his contract is structured. We don’t have to pay him that much, and Mathews can bring a spark off the bench. That being said, I don’t see another organization giving up much to acquire him.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I am by no means predicting that these players will be traded, just that I wouldn’t be surprised if they were. It just depends on what offers are actually available. It would be sad to see anyone go, but we must prepare ourselves for a potential reality. The lineup needs more cohesion as a unit, and some smaller moves around the edges could help that tremendously. Right now, there’s too much talent that isn’t being given a chance to succeed. If we can extract their value for another player in the future atZ a similar level, then that could be the thing to do. When Houston decides to be competitive, there will almost certainly be more spots open at the back-end of the rotation. Right now, we don’t want to give up on anybody too soon, which is the main reason for the minutes crisis the team is currently facing.</p>
