        <h1>3 Players Who Could Surprisingly Have Their Time In Houston Cut Short</h1>
        <p>The Houston Rockets’ team is going to change a lot over the next few years in pursuit of winning an NBA championship. Some guys that are presumably safe for now may be gone sooner than you think. The front office is constantly looking for ways to make this lineup better long term, and unfortunately that comes at the expense of trading away different players. This article may give you an idea of who they might be. We already have some obvious picks, like Eric Gordon and Kenyon Martin Jr., so it won't be including either of them here. Please also keep in mind that I have no insider knowledge and this is all just purely speculation.</p>
        <h2>Jae’Sean Tate</h2>
        <p>Tate is already 26 years old, despite this only being his 3rd season in the NBA. At that age, he’s just outside the range of the rest of the Rockets’ young players. He is also going to have a lot of competition on the roster. Tate did just recently receive a 3-year extension worth about $22 million, but that doesn’t mean much. The fact that the organization can let him develop over the next couple years before shipping him off as an expiring contract, makes me question his long term future with the team. The franchise may simply find a better option down the line that fits better age-wise, costs less, or provides more value on the court. I’m not saying this would happen this season, but maybe the next or the year after. I just don’t see a world where Jae’Sean Tate is a member, much less a starter, when the Rockets are trying to be competitive again. Unfortunately, he fits the mold of an asset that gets shipped off when a team tries to go all in.</p>
        <h2>Daishen Nix</h2>
        <p>As of now, in my opinion, Daishen Nix is ultimately going to lose the backup point guard battle to Tyty Washington for several reasons. Washington looks better in the offense, fits better off the bench, and has more of a cult following among fans than Nix likely ever will. This could put him on shaky ground within the organization. This year is the only one where he’s guaranteed a contract, so the Rockets could just let him walk when free agency hits next summer. If he becomes obsolete on the roster, I very well could see this happening. However, this is all very dependent on how he plays this season. Nix is on a “prove-it'' type contract, where his success in the future could matter based on what he shows right now. I’m not sure that he’ll have much value on the open market, and he may just end up back in the G-league. Not everybody can make it with only 15 roster spots, and on the Rockets there certainly isn't one to waste. Time will tell on this one for sure.</p>
        <h2>Tari Eason</h2>
        <p>Shocker. I know. Tari Eason has been absolutely incredible to start his NBA career, and I’m not saying that anyone should doubt him at all. I’m afraid we’ll see him become too good and have too much trade value to just keep. Some team is going to look at him as an up and coming star, and be willing to give up quality veterans to get him. In about 1-2 years, I could see the Rockets packaging him and some salary filler to make a “win-now” move. Granted, this may happen with any of the young players, but Eason is not as essential in the eyes of many, compared to players like Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., and Kevin Porter Jr. Rafael Stone and his team are going to be pressured into making a big move eventually, and Eason is just my pick to be the one included in it. This could be similar to when we saw the Lakers package Brandon Ingram and a few other assets to land Anthony Davis. Another option I considered was Alperen Sengun, and I could also see that one happening as well. I just feel like Eason is going to have more value and play at a position with less need for this team. Unfortunately, hitting on draft picks can sometimes be both a blessing and a curse.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I think Tate is the only of these 3 names to be possibly moved at the trade deadline. Finding Eric Gordon a new home is the first logical move to make, and then the organization can go from there. Nobody likes to see their favorites move onto another team or fall completely out of the league, but it is something that usually has to happen in order for a city to win a championship. The Lakers traded away lots of their young pieces to get a second star alongside Lebron James, the Bucks had to give up RJ Hampton and a bunch of picks to land Jrue Holiday, and the Warriors traded away D’angelo Russel for Andrew Wiggins. All 3 teams won championships in the following seasons. Yes, there are some trades like these that fail, but the reality is moves have to be made to win a ring. As much as I hate to say it, these are just my predictions for who it could be. Treating human beings as assets is a necessary evil of most major sports. The Houston Rockets are not exempt from this reality.</p>
