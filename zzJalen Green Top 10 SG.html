        <h1>Is Jalen Green a Top-10 NBA Shooting Guard Right Now In Year 2?</h1>
        <p>Jalen Green is beginning to emerge as a star right before our eyes, but where exactly does he rank among other top shooting guards? Some people may jump to conclusions and immediately say that he is at least top 10, if not top 5, but that is not the correct way to look at it. The 2 has been arguably the weakest position over the last few years, with none of them being close to taking home the MVP award since James Harden in 2018; before that it was Kobe Bryant all the way back in 2008. Right now, there are clearly some players ranked above Green: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Desmond Bane, and Shai Gilegous-Alexander. That’s 8 names right there.</p>
        <p>The next tier gets a little more complicated. Of course you guys like Anthony Edwards, Dejounte Murray, Tyrese Maxey, and Anfernee Simons to consider. While all of these players are not the first option on their respective teams, like Green is with Houston, they are probably the best competition for the final 2 spots in the top ten. The former 2nd overall pick is still developing daily, but where does he stand right now? The answer to that is obviously going to be opinion based; however, consider the following before jumping to conclusions. I’m going to try and be as objective as possible when going through these comparisons.</p>
        <h2>Anthony Edwards</h2>
        <h4>2022-2023 Stats Per Game: 23.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 0.4 blocks, 1.8 steals</h4>
        <p>The real question here is: Is Anothy Edwards better in year 3 than Jalen Green is in year 2? I believe the answer to that right now is yes. For reference, Jalen Green’s current numbers are: 21.3 points, 4.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.3 blocks. Edwards has him beat across the board and is doing it more efficiently while behind arguably both Rudy Gobert and Karl Anthony-Towns. Granted, Towns has been out for a while with an injury, but my point still stands. Plus, when you factor in team success, the Wolves are vying for a Play-In spot while the Rockets are dead last in the Western Conference. This one shouldn’t even really be a discussion.</p>
        <h2>Dejounte Murray</h2>
        <h4>2022-2023 Stats Per Game: 20.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 0.4 blocks, 1.8 steals</h4>
        <p>Dejounte Murray is now in his first season with the Atlanta Hawks after being traded last off-season by the San Antonio Spurs. Fresh off an All-Star appearance, he teamed up with Trae Young to form a dynamic backcourt in the Eastern Conference. Now this one is a little bit closer, but I think Murray is currently better than Jalen Green. He is a more complete player than Green, at this stage in their careers, and is way better on defense. Murray even earned a spot on the All-Defensive 2nd Team a few years back. The former g-league Ignite member doesn’t have the accolades or defense to make me pick him. The slight advantage Green has in scoring/shot-creation ability is outweighed by everything else in favor of the reigning All-star.</p>
        <h2>Tyrese Maxey</h2>
        <h4>2022-2023 Stats Per Game: 22.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.3 blocks, 1.0 steals</h4>
        <p>Tyrese Maxey is a different story. This is his first breakout year, in which he has played only 15 games so far. I’m just saying we don’t know if he’s going to be very consistent, just yet. Don’t get me wrong, he was good last season, just not at this level. If we’re comparing last year’s Maxey to this year’s Green, then Green easily takes it. Even with factoring in this season, I think I would still pick Jalen Green. Maxey doesn't have any defensive advantages and the 76ers have been playing better since his injury, after a rough start to the season. This just could be coincidence, but is definitely worth noting.</p>
        <h2>Anfernee Simons</h2>
        <h4>2022-2023 Stats Per Game: 23.2 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 0.2 blocks, 0.8 steals</h4>
        <p>Anfernee Simons and Jalen Green, in my eyes right now, are dead even. I could really go with either side. Simons has more of a scoring punch, but that may just be temporary until Damian Lillard starts playing more consistently. I am also impressed that Simons is shooting nearly 40% from 3 compared to Green’s 31%. In contrast, Green is a better rebounder and better on defense. If I had to pick, I would go with Simons just barely because of how good he’s been recently. Against Houston just a few nights ago, he put up 32 points compared to Green’s 15. I just can’t deny that matchup happening, and clearly Simons was the better player.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If we go based on these conclusions, Jalen Green is currently just outside the top 10 NBA shooting guards. He’s somewhere around the 11-13 range, which is just slightly above average. There are also others to consider like Tyler Herro, Klay Thompson, and CJ McCollumm, who I didn’t even mention. It’s just too early for Green to be considered top 10 at his position, but that day is not too far away. With the way he’s progressing, I could easily see it happening by the beginning of next season. Jalen Green is coming and he is coming fast. The league better watch out. He’s just on the cusp of making some serious noise, and once the Rockets improve so will his ranking among more and more fans.</p>
