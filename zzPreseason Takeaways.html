        <h1>5 Takeways From the Rockets' 2022 Preseason Now That It's All Over</h1>
        <p>Friday’s win over the Indiana Pacers, 122-144, officially marked the end of the preseason for the Houston Rockets. This means that we are only a few days away from the team’s first real game of NBA basketball. With so much to look forward to, let’s recap exactly what we saw in these initial 4 games. I’ll start with the obvious. The Rockets are one of the flashiest groups in the league, and we saw highlight dunks, what felt like every few minutes. It seems like everybody’s athleticism is off the charts, which is good considering they are all very young. This also led them to play at a very fast pace. If you can outrun your opponent in the fastbreak, those are easy points to take advantage of, which we saw happen on several occasions. Below are some things that we may not have expected going in, but are definitely worth taking note of.</p>
        <p>All stats referenced are courtesy of  <a href="https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Houston-Rockets/10/Stats/2023/Averages/All/points/All/desc/1/Preseason">Real GM</a></p>
        <h2>Tari Eason Is Already Elite</h2>
        <p>Being picked at #17 in the NBA draft, I wasn’t exactly sure what to make of how much of an impact Tari Eason would have on this team right away. He led the roster in scoring, outside of Jabari Smith Jr. who only played 1 game as well as Jalen Green, and rebounding while coming off of the bench in all 4 of his outings. It’s just unheard of for a non-lottery pick rookie to come in and average 20.7 points and 10 rebounds from day 1. Granted, he is already 21 years old, but if he’s playing at this high of a level now, there’s no reason to doubt him going forward. In Summer League he absolutely dominated among other rookies and it was no different in the preseason. I’m not even sure the organization knew how good Eason would be even before his first actual game. The better he gets, the better the James Harden trade is going to look, considering he is the first tangible piece to come from that haul of draft capital.</p>
        <h2>Jalen Green and KPJ Look Amazing Together</h2>
        <p>When the starters were out on the floor, it just felt like everything ran so smoothly between KPJ and Jalen Green. Even though we only saw Green for about 26 minutes a night, he still managed to post numbers of 22 points, 3.3 assists, 3 rebounds, and 0.8 steals a game. It was a similar story for Porter. The questions surrounding their fit together as a backcourt duo have been answered in my eyes. There was a notable difference when one of these two was running the offense as opposed to someone else. This is just reinforcing my belief that the Rockets need to offer KPJ an extension now before his price goes way up. At this moment in time, the team seems to be set with two quality guards for many years to come. I don’t want to overreact, but it’s clear that they have a lot more chemistry than James Harden and Chris Paul ever did, which has to be scary for everybody else.</p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun Has Been Underwhelming So Far</h2>
        <p>Sengun has been given the starting center spot, ever since the Rockets traded Christian Wood, and along with that comes more responsibility. Unfortunately, he hasn’t lived up to what I know his potential is just yet. In 3 games, Sengun averaged 9 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 0.7 blocks per contest, leaving many fans wanting more. To be honest, he was outplayed by Kenyon Martin Jr., which just isn’t a good look. However, I think he still needs time to adjust back to the NBA and his new role with the team. This summer, he spent his time playing in EuroBasket, which, as you probably know, has very different rules compared to the NBA. In addition, the former Turkish League MVP also is learning how to play off his “new” teammates. Even though most of them aren’t new per se, they are new to Sengun because he was moved from the bench unit to the starting lineup. Once the Rockets can get him, KPJ, and Jalen Green all to play off of each other effectively, things will look a lot better. This may just be an issue that can be resolved with time and reps, though.</p>
        <h2>Jabari Smith Jr Is the Real Deal</h2>
        <p>Although we only saw one game from Smith in the preseason, it was very impressive. He had 21 points, 8 rebounds, and 2 assists in only 34 and a half minutes. We got a glimpse at the potential of what he can add to both the offense and defense this upcoming season. Summer League, for him, didn’t live up to the hype of being the consensus top prospect for months, so I was glad to see Smith turn it around. His fit with the rest of the players is just so seamless. Sengun is able to work inside while Smith spaces the floor and defends on the perimeter. He gives this lineup another scoring threat, and his defensive upside is unmatched. The injury that kept him out is fully healed, which means we’ll see him to start the season. It was a miracle that he fell to the Rockets at #3, and during the one game we saw, he proved why.</p>
        <h2>Tyty Washington Jr. vs Daishen Nix Update</h2>
        <p>This battle for minutes at the backup point guard spot has probably been the most competitive. In preseason, we saw Nix being played over Washington even though Washington seemed to be more productive in the minutes he was given. The latter averaged more points in significantly less time than Nix, which was somewhat surprising to many. The eye test also suggests that Washington may end up earning this spot. Nix looked a bit reckless at times, averaging 3 turnovers a game, and had moments of utter catastrophe. Not to say Washington was perfect, but from what we saw, he looked a lot better to me. This may mark the beginning of a shift on the depth chart, but we still need to see more before jumping to conclusions. If you want more information on this topic, check out my article <a href="zzTyTy Washington vs Daishen Nix 2022.html">here</a> that goes into a lot more detail.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Nothing really matters until we get to the regular season, but that doesn’t mean these first 4 games won’t have an impact on that. It was nice to root for the Rockets without the constant thought in the back of my head of worrying about messing up our lottery odds. As we get closer and closer to the tipoff of game 1, the anticipation continues to build. Finishing with a record of 3-1 may be a good sign of things to come. Nonetheless, I don’t want to overreact too quickly. Before we know it, October will be over and we will have a much larger sample size to analyze. Overall, I am definitely happy with most of what we saw from these past few weeks.</p>
