        <h1>Should Kevin Porter Jr. Be the Long-Term Solution at Point Guard For the Houston Rockets</h1>
        <p>Probably the best trade the Rockets have made in recent history was when they sent a top-55 protected 2nd round pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kevin Porter Jr., back in 2021. The former 30th overall pick was an integral piece that jump-started the Rockets rebuild, but with an extension looming, it is time to decide if he’s going to be a long term fit. Fortunately, he’s still only 22 years old, so there’s no question of whether or not he is on the same timeline as the rest of his teammates. The true issue is deciding if he has done enough to this point to warrant a contract extension that locks him down for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <h2>What We Have Seen So Far</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, KPJ has been labeled as a player with off-the-court issues, especially after the incident that occurred when the Rockets battled the Denver Nuggets on January 1, 2022. Porter reportedly threw an object at Rockets’ coach, John Lucas, and then left the area during halftime. As you would imagine, this broke some trust between him and the organization. However, people do change and that may be the case for KPJ. From an outsider's perspective, it seems like the relationship between him and the organization has only continued to get stronger since that event. Despite that, events like this cannot be ignored when considering his future as a member of the Houston Rockets.</p>
        <p>Although Porter’s play last season was good, it certainly left something to be desired. He finished the season with averages of 15.6 points, 4.4 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.4 blocks. Having said that, this stat line does come with the asterisk of having to learn to play point guard instead of his natural position at shooting guard. One of the standout moments of his career so far is when he had a 50-point outburst against the Milwaukee Bucks on April 29, 2021. The flashes of greatness have definitely existed, but we’ve haven’t seen it sustained over a long period of time. For that reason, many have begun to question if we can really trust that his game is going to develop substantially in the future.</p>
        <h2>Should He Be Here For the Long Term?</h2>
        <p>KPJ is due for an extension this off-season before entering the final year of his contract. That begs the question: Should he be offered one, and at what price? Most fans expect his value to be placed in the $10-$20 million dollars per season range, but at what point is the price just too high. A 4 year/60 million dollar extension might be the perfect amount. Maybe add a team option on the 4th year, or make portions of it non-guaranteed. Those in favor of giving him a new contract say that we need to lock him down before he raises his value next season and that even if he falls out of the starting lineup, at that price, it still makes sense for him to come off of the bench.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, KPJ is going to be a restricted free agent, meaning that the Rockets will have an opportunity to match any contract he may receive. Therefore, even without an extension, the Rockets have the ultimate power when deciding whether or not to keep him. Why risk giving him money over several years now when you have another season to watch him play before making a decision. It could become evident that the fit alongside Jalen Green just isn’t working, or that more issues outside of basketball may arise. Even if he balls out, the price increase may not be significant enough to worry about getting him under a multi-year contract as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, I would offer KPJ a 4 year/$56 million contract that is front-loaded and has a team option on the 4th year. Whether or not he would accept something like this, I don’t know. Reports have been saying the franchise and Porter have mutual interest in coming to an agreement before training camp starts, but that only remains true at the right price. The only thing I’m hesitant about is that the Rockets might draft a point guard in the next NBA draft, which would mean KPJ would become the 6th man. At that point, you really don’t want to pay somebody more than $15 million to not start. This is one of the reasons the Rockets are still stuck with Eric Gordon. Right now it could go both ways, but time will tell what really happens.
