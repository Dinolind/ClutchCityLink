        <h1>Laying Out the Potential Timeline For the Houston Rockets Going Forward.</h1>
        <p>As the Rockets’ rebuild slowly progresses, some fans have become a little impatient and are in constant questioning about when the team will finally be good again. We were spoiled for so long with having a quality playoff roster during the 8 year run of being among the top 16 teams. It had to come to an end eventually, and now that it has, it can be hard to see your team go from competing for championships to having the worst record in the league for back-to-back seasons. Even with all the young talent, nothing has materialized and some people are pushing for a big name to be brought in just to make the playoffs, but I can assure you that is not the path to true success.</p>
        <p>The Rockets do have a plan in place to become relevant again, but it cannot happen overnight. Just look at the 76ers, who intentionally sunk to the bottom of the league for 4 consecutive seasons and now have been a top seed in recent years. Even with one of their #1 overall picks, Markelle Fultz, not panning out the way they had hoped, the 76ers were still stacked with 4 all star caliber players in the 2019 playoffs. So far, it has not ended with a championship, but with an MVP type player in Joel Embiid, you never really know.</p>
        <p>So that brings us to today. The Rockets currently have two recent top three picks currently on the roster in Jabari Smith Jr. and Jalen Green, but both are still incredibly young and are not win-now type players. Combine that with other youthful talents like KPJ and Alperen Sengun and it becomes obvious pretty quickly that the rebuilding mode is still in full effect. Patience is going to be what wins this core a championship. Rushing into a big time splash rarely works without the proper pieces in place. However, this could all happen sooner than many think with the pool of assets that have been acquired in recent years. What follows are my predictions for each season leading up to the Rockets taking home the Larry O’brian Trophy.</p>
        <h4>2022-2023 Season: Projected Record (24-58, Miss Playoffs)</h4>
        <p>This upcoming season will be another year focused on progression while the team is still towards the bottom of the standings. Drafting 3 new rookies in addition to the 4 from last year means the team will be very inexperienced and it will show. Next season is also going to show us who is going to be on the roster long-term and who needs to go. While they may not be very good, it will be fun to watch a ton of athletic youngsters figure out the NBA. Chemistry and experience will be built, while the team remains at the top of the lottery to add another top-tier prospect. It must be done, but hopefully this is the last season of watching a below .500 squad as the full-on tank nears its end. Luckily, the reward for another terrible season will be another top pick, which I am sure will be used wisely.</p>
        <h4>2023-2024 Season: Projected Record (42-40, First Round Exit)</h4>
        <p>The 2023-2024 season marks the first of three years where the Rockets no longer have control of their own first round picks that were sent to the Thunder in the Russell Westbrook trade. This means they no longer have any incentive to lose. Furthermore, the organization is expected to have around $60 million dollars in cap space to throw at free agents in the offseason, which is another one of the reasons I expect a big jump. Adding a max player to a roster full of young guys beginning to hit the next level is a recipe for success. I believe this season will mark a point where the rebuild is officially finished. However, this team will still need more time to learn how to play together efficiently and several players will only be NBA sophomores, which is why I don’t see the Rockets being championship contenders just yet.</p>
        <h4>2024-2025 Season: Projected Record (48-34, Second Round Exit)</h4>
        <p>This is the first year where I see the Rockets potentially making some noise in the playoffs. With a projected starting 5 of KPJ plus 3 top draft picks and a max free agent, this could be a breakthrough year. Once again, the team has no incentive to lose and Jalen Green, on an expiring deal, will be playing hard to earn his new contract. This is the first year where none of the top picks will be in their rookie seasons, provided that the organization follows this timeline. The 2025 playoffs will establish the team as a Western Conference powerhouse for years to come, and the league will certainly take notice.</p>
        <h4>2025-2026 Season: Projected Record (54-28, Conference Finals Exit)</h4>
        <p>Another conference finals run has been something every Rockets fan has been hoping for since their crushing defeat to the Warriors in 2018, and I think this is the year that it happens. This will no longer be a young team with promise but an experienced team with loads of talent. Everybody will be a year older and have 2 years of playoff experience up to this point, which has boded well for teams in the past. See, for example, the Celtics, who just made the NBA finals. The loss in the conference finals will be devastating but will remind the organization to not get comfortable and to keep their foot on the gas.
        </p>
        <h4>2026-2027 Season: Projected Record (63-19, NBA Champions)</h4>
        <p>As Jalen Green raises the Larry O’Brien trophy and looks out at a packed toyota center, diehard Rockets fans everywhere will remember everything the team went through to get here. This is the year where I think the team puts it all together, as the young guys enter their primes and the vets are still young enough to contribute. I predict the Rockets will make a big move in the 2026 offseason that propels them to this position, similar to what the Bucks did in 2021. This will cap off one of the greatest rebuilds of all time and prove the Rockets really were, to quote James Harden, “1 piece away”, just in a completely different era.</p>
        <p>Having two championship caliber teams within 10 years after going through a complete rebuild will be an impressive feat for this organization. A championship would prove that trading Harden for all those picks was the best decision ever made, and Rafael Stone will soon retire as one of the greatest GMs in NBA history. It’s going to be an amazing day when the Rockets land a top 3 pick from the nets a month after winning the NBA championship. The team will have built a dynasty to last them the next however many years and may even break their own playoff streak record. 5 seasons is all it is going to take for the Rockets to become the next Golden State Warriors with 4 all-stars and a top 5 pick. Be patient because greatness is coming. Losing now isn’t easy, but winning on this scale in the future will make it all worth it.</p>
