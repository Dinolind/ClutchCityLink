        <h1>2 Underlying Storylines For The Houston Rockets Heading Into the Regular Season</h1>
        <p>The NBA season is finally upon us. In just a few hours, the Rockets will face off against the Atlanta Hawks at the State Farm Arena. Everything is falling into place. The Rockets waived Derrick Favors, signed KPJ to an extension, and cut their roster down to the maximum of 15 that they’re allowed. Many of our off-season questions have been answered, but in saying that, now ones have begun to emerge, and will continue to in the future. Before the team kicks off the year, here are some of the things you should watch for as the season unfolds.</p>
        <h2>Sophomore Improvement</h2>
        <p>By this I don’t just mean the 4 picks from the 2021 draft, but also players who are in the 2nd year for the Houston Rockets. Everybody is expected to improve tremendously between their 1st and 2nd years in the league, but that doesn’t always happen. In my opinion, the Rockets have too many young guys that are expected to take a jump, that somebody is going to disappoint, and it’ll be interesting to see who that someone is. There’s only so many minutes to go around, and we can’t give all of the guys a bigger role. Otherwise, nobody would have a bigger role. Naturally, something is going to give.</p>
        <p>Is KPJ going to live up to his extension? Can Jalen Green work his way into All-Star conversations? Is Alperen Sengun fit to be a starter in the NBA? All of these are questions that will be answered sooner or later. Even guys like Usman Garuba, Bruno Fernando, Josh Christopher, and Daishen Nix all have a lot to prove. Rookie seasons are often just flashes of what a player could be, and now it’s time for some of these names to put it together. It’ll be interesting to see who prevails and who falls behind on the roster. As a rebuilding team, nobody has their spot guaranteed, and everybody has added something new over the summer to show the world.</p>
        <h2>Bench Unit Question Marks</h2>
        <p>The Rockets bench over the past few years has fluctuated a lot, and I assume that will continue going forward. There are like 14 players on the roster I could see getting consistent minutes, and it just seems unlikely that Stephen Silas will run a 14-man rotation. Yes, there will be injuries, but some players just are going to outplay others for minutes. This year is going to be important for certain guys to establish their role in the lineup. As the season progresses, I believe the Rockets organization will choose their bench wisely, and ship out those who just don’t fit what the team needs. Of course, it’ll be intriguing to see which guys fall where, but it may end the tenure in Houston for many fan favorites.</p>
        <p>Right now, I would assume an 11 man rotation seems the most likely. With no injuries, the starters are currently KPJ, Jalen Green, Eric Gordon, Jabari Smith Jr., and Alperen Sengun. Some clear cut guys that are also likely to get minutes are Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, Bruno Fernando, and I would like to think, Josh Christopher. That leaves only two spots. One would probably go to either Daishen Nix or Tyty Washington jr., and the other is really up in the air. Realistically, only one of the following guys would be in the rotation if everybody was healthy: Kenyon Martin Jr., Garrison Matthews, Usman Garuba. That means three guys along with Boban Marjanovic are going to be left out. It’s certainly a tough decision to make.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I hope this season is utilized more effectively than the last one. At least the Rockets didn’t go out and sign someone like Daniel Thies, as they did last year, which really messed with the team’s dynamics. This move cost them a good portion of the year, and I think the organization has learned from their mistake. We need our young guys to mess up now, learn, and improve, not focus on wins and losses. From a business standpoint, the Rockets need to figure out which young pieces to keep and which ones to get rid of. As much as it sucks, that’s a part of sports, and for the Rockets a lot of the decision-making will be based on this season. I can’t wait to see it all play out and hopefully end with a championship a few years later.</p>
