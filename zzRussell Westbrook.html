        <h1>The Downfall of Russell Westbrook and the 2020 Houston Rockets</h1>
        <p>With training camp less than two weeks away, the excitement for this new team is continuing to grow. However, it wasn’t too long ago that the Houston Rockets held the longest active streak for consecutive playoff appearances. So, what happened? The short answer is that we traded away James Harden, but the long answer reveals how it came to those circumstances. The Rockets had been on the cusp of making it to the finals, only to be taken down by the Warriors year after year. With the Warriors losing Kevin Durant in the off-season, the Rockets seemed to be poised to make a run, yet they fell short.</p>
        <p>Probably the biggest change the Rockets made between the 2019 and 2020 seasons was the substitution of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook. It became evident that the chemistry between CP3 and Harden just wasn’t there anymore, so something had to be done. That something was attaching assets to Chris Paul’s contract in return for Westbrook. This may unfortunately go down as one of Darryl Morey’s worst moves as the Rockets’ general manager. Knowing what we know now, many fans wished it would’ve never happened.</p>
        <h2>What Went Wrong?</h2>
        <p>Harden wanted to play with Westbrook, or so we thought. The only reason the combination of two ball-dominant guards was ever proposed was because of how well it worked with Chris Paul. Otherwise, I believe this never would’ve happened. The difference was that Westbrook refused to alter his playstyle in order to fit what the team needed. That along with his poor shooting ability, meant he could only play with certain players effectively. James Harden was excluded from that group. This was perhaps most clearly defined when the Rockets traded one of their only young pieces, Clint Capela, for Robert Covington around the trade deadline.</p>
        <p>This move did help Russ temporarily, but eventually his production slowed down when Harden started to demand more touches. Another issue with the new lineup was that they had no way of stopping anyone that was 7ft tall and decent at basketball. As much as I love PJ Tucker, he’s a wing, not a center. Westbrook also had several injuries throughout the season. Sadly, just as the players were finally putting something together, the NBA got shut down for Covid. The bubble environment was just not something James Harden had ever been used to, given his clubbing antics, and it clearly showed. What little chance they had, kept getting smaller with every violation of the Covid protocols.</p>
        <h2>How it Ended</h2>
        <p>The Rockets finished the season with a record of 44-28, which was tied for as low as the 6th seed. They did have the tiebreaker over the Thunder and the Jazz, but this was their lowest seed out of the last few years. Round 1 vs the Thunder was a lot closer than it should’ve been. The Thunder were not an opponent that was supposed to take the Rockets to a nail-biting game 7, but that’s exactly what happened. This series was when it became crystal clear that the team really had no shot. Sure enough, they were bounced from the playoffs by the Lakers in 5 games during the next round.</p>
        <p>The team looked terrible during that series after the first game. The Lakers kept trapping Harden on every possession, and Russ was simply atrocious after coming back from an injury. The Lakers exposed the fact that the Rockets had zero consistent shot creators, outside of Harden. The Chris Paul effect was more prominent at this moment than ever before. We all know what happened next. Westbrook was now on one of the worst contracts in the entire league, and got traded for John Wall a few months later. This was the beginning of the end of the Harden era. He was traded to the Brooklyn Nets about 2 weeks into the 2021 season, and the Rockets have been rebuilding ever since.</p>
        <p>Westbrook may go down as one of the players to fall off the quickest after winning an MVP. He hasn’t had a season without any backlash since winning the award, unless you count his time spent in Washington. It’s crazy how quickly the roster fell part. It went from being one-piece away to an utter disaster in just a few months. Now, with Westbrook having yet another bad season with the Lakers, his time in the NBA may run out sooner than expected. The Lakers just signed Dennis Schroder, which almost confirms that fact that they are still looking to move him before the start of next season. With this being the last year of his contract, who knows what could happen next.</p>
