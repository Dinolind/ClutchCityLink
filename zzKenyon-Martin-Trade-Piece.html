        <h1>Is Kenyon Martin Jr. Still a Viable Trade Piece For the Rockets In 2023?</h1>
        <p>Kenyon Martin Jr. is a solid young asset that will surely be moved this trade deadline, right? Wrong. Martin’s situation is very complicated at this point, but what we do know for sure is that he did request to be traded about 6 months ago. Does that request still stand, or has the view shifted to him being considered a long-term part of the roster? I think that answer to that is a combination of those things. There’s no doubt that him staying on the roster is a real possibility, but then again, everyone has their price. Per Shams Charania, Martin’s value, according to the Rockets’ front office, is a promising prospect or a very good first round pick.</p>
        <p>Determining whether or not other teams perceive his value as being that high is another story. At face value, the former 52nd overall pick seems like a good player, who posts numbers of 10.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 0.3 blocks, and 0.4 steals on solid efficiency in only about 34 minutes per game this season. He also has good defensive capabilities, is super athletic, and brings hustle to back it all up. However, those numbers could just be empty stats on a bad team, his free throw percentage is borderline atrocious, and the potential for him to be a star in the making just isn’t really there.</p>
        <h2>Why Trade Him Anyways?</h2>
        <p>The reasons for trading Martin have begun to dwindle, but I’ll try my best to justify it. First off, his current contract is set to expire at the end of next season. That means he’s eligible for an extension either now, or starting in a few months. I’m not quite sure. Either way, though, he’s going to have to get paid and I’m not sure if Houston wants to be the one to pay him. This is all assuming a new hefty contract is warranted by the time a decision has to be made. The front office could ship him off for presumably an incoming rookie and essentially reset the timeline for that roster spot. Whether or not this is a goal of theirs is yet to be revealed, though, it is worth noting.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, his original minutes concern is still a real issue to an extent. Guys such as Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, and Usman Garuba all occupy basically the same role as Martin and could move ahead of him in the rotation eventually. There is also now a documented instance of somebody wanting to be moved, suggesting that he won’t ever be 100% fully committed to the city or winning games. Speaking of winning games, is KJ Martin good enough to earn plenty of minutes on a championship roster? In my opinion right now, No. Serious development is going to have to take place for me to even consider him as a possible starter in a few years time. I’m not saying that it can’t happen, just that I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>
        <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
        <p>The future destination spots for him aren’t very plentiful for this trade deadline for multiple reasons. Since the Rockets want essentially a lottery first rounder, then he would have to be traded to a lottery team. The problem with that is those teams would probably rather have their own selection in a loaded draft, over KJ Martin. That leaves basically only organizations that are trying to compete, and have draft assets from a lottery franchisee to trade away. As you can imagine, these organizations are few and far between. Even if they do have an asset like that, I’m pretty sure they would package it with a few other assets for a star instead of a role player.</p>
        <p>I just don’t see a trade coming along that makes sense for both teams involved. That is unless another player is thrown into the deal, such as Eric Gordon. A move like this would probably see Houston take back some expiring contracts and picks in return for Gordon and Martin. The team that makes the most sense for this scenario in my eyes is the Washington Wizards. Something like Rui Hachimura, Will Barton, and a future first rounder (because they don’t have their own this season) would be enough for both guys, I assume. The Pelicans also have some very appealing draft capital from the Lakers, and an unwanted younger player in Jaxon Hayes. If it’s possible to make the money match, a transaction could work with them as well.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The Martin interest is there across the league for sure, but as with most trades, the logistics get complicated. I think a move is going to be eventually made, but not at this trade deadline. We and everybody else needs to see what he’ll actually become before he is dealt. The only way it could happen is with Eric Gordon, who has been in many rumors for the past few years. Surprisingly, we’re only just over a month away from the deadline, so things are going to have to start happening sooner rather than later. Hopefully the lineup can be refined and the organization can set itself up for future success. The message right now should be that every player has a price, and we are willing to listen. As a rebuilding team, it would be foolish to rule out anything entirely.</p>
