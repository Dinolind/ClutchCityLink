        <h1>Should Dennis Schroder Return to the Houston Rockets? If Not, Where Could He End Up?</h1>
        <p>Dennis Schroder was a solid backup point guard for the Rockets last season, but now his contract has expired and his future seems uncertain. He’s one of those players that has bounced around the league for a while, since leaving the Atlanta Hawks back in 2018, and he may be off to his next team pretty soon. Schroder still remains on the free agent market with less than a month left before the start of the NBA season. I doubt he’ll be out of the league entirely, given his skillset and that he’s only 28, so where exactly could he end up?</p>
        <h2>Houston</h2>
        <p>The Rockets are in a rebuilding phase, yes, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need at least some veterans. Schroder can use his speed to keep up with the fast-paced offense fans hope to see next season, and we could always use another facilitator. However, his opportunity may be limited. KPJ and Jalen Green are almost certainly going to occupy the starting guard spots, and Josh Christopher is likely going to come off the bench. That means, at best Schroder could be the backup point guard, but will still have to compete with other players like Daishen Nix and TyTy Washington to earn that position.</p>
        <p>Both of the other options are more likely to be here long term, so it’s going to be tough for Schroder to earn minutes over them. Unless he comes back on a minimum contract, I think the Rockets organization would rather just pass on him. They are not trying to win games more so than they are trying to give minutes to young players to help their development. Even if he does resign, I think his talents would be wasted in Houston. He is entering his prime and needs to go somewhere that can better utilize his abilities. It’s sad to say, but I think he recognizes that too.</p>
        <h2>Phoenix Suns</h2>
        <p>Right now, the Suns’ potential backup point guard is either Cameron Payne or Elfrid Payton. I believe that Schroder is better than both of those players, and would easily earn minutes. Not only that, but the Suns are coming off being the 1 seed last season, and Schroder could be an X-factor for them come playoff time. Chris Paul is getting older, and he likely won’t be able to play 40 minutes every night. Plus, he and Schroder already have chemistry from their time spent together in OKC. Why not reunite this duo in pursuit of winning a championship? It wouldn’t cost them very much, and adding him could be a huge win.</p>
        <h2>Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
        <p>If the Lakers pull off the Westbrook trade for Buddy Hield and Myles Turner, they’re going to need a point guard. While a reunion between Schroder and the organization could be a bit awkward, it would benefit both parties. A starting lineup of Schroder, Hield, Lebron, Anthony Davis, and Myles Turner has a very high chance of being a championship contender. Furthermore, he may be the only option the Lakers have for a point guard on a presumably small contract. The team is in a rough state after missing the playoffs, and a move like this could drastically improve their record next season.</p>
        <h2>Washington Wizards</h2>
        <p>The Wizards showed this off-season that they’re not looking to rebuild when they signed Bradley Beal to a 5 year/$251 million contract. With Westbrook long gone, the organization doesn’t have a quality backcourt player to play alongside Beal, with their best option currently being Monte Morris. Schroder has a much higher ceiling than Morris, and it’s not like the Wizards would have to risk blowing up a championship-caliber team to bring him in. If it doesn’t work out, just let him go next season. If it does, however, the Wizards could make a jump in the standings. They’re a team that needs to start making moves now before it’s too late, and adding Schroder could be a part of that.</p>
        <h2>So What?...</h2>
        <p>Dennis Schroder has been focusing on playing overseas recently, but as soon as he wants to, there should be teams eager to sign him. He needs to be given a “prove-it” contract, to show that he can still be a quality NBA player. It’s sad to see how he’s struggling to maintain a roster spot after being offered a $84 million extension by the Lakers just a season ago. When he turned down that extension, it set a bad precedent for his reputation. Maybe teams are unlikely to get involved with him because they saw what he did to the Lakers. Anyways, I think it won’t be long before we get a headline revealing his new destination.</p>
