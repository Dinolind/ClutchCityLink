        <h1>Why Jabari Smith Jr Will Be The 2022 NBA Rookie Of The Year Ahead Of Others</h1>
        <p>On June 23, 2022, the Orlando Magic shocked the world when they selected Paolo Banchero with the 1st overall pick. It seemed like an easy choice, Jabari Smith Jr had been the consensus top guy for months, with reports from reputable sources reaffirming that belief, but the Magic chose to pass on a generational talent. Ever since that day, Smith has been on a mission to prove that he was deserving of the top spot, and that is one of the reasons why I think he will be the 2023 NBA rookie of the year.</p>
        <p>Over 5 Summer League games, Smith averaged an impressive 14.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks in roughly 29 minutes a game, all while struggling to make his shots. Smith has proved that he is a knockdown shooter over the course of his collegiate career, so you could expect those numbers to be higher in the regular season. While I understand that this is Summer League, Smith will most likely receive a similar number of minutes and opportunity this upcoming year.</p>
        <p>The fact the Smith will face tougher defenses and likely convert on more shot attempts essentially cancel each other. If we compare smith’s Summer League stats to the rookie year stats of the past 5 winners of the award, we get something that looks like this:</p>
        <h4>Jabari Smith Jr.: 14.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists </h4>
        <h4>Scottie Barnes: 15.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists </h4>
        <h4>LaMelo Ball: 15.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, 6.1 assists</h4>
        <h4>Ja Morant: 17.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, 7.3 assists</h4>
        <h4>Luka Doncic: 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 6.0 assists </h4>
        <h4>Ben Simmons: 15.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, 8.2 assists</h4>
        <p>With Doncic being an outlier, Smith fits in well. Smith is also likely to get better over the course of the season and have superior teammates around him compared to Summer League, further increasing his production. Smith’s main competition for the award is probably going to be Chet Holmgren given that, like Smith, he is the number 2 or 3 option on his team, will have the ball in his hands a lot, and is likely to receive a substantial amount of minutes on a regular basis. What sets the two apart is Smith’s defense.</p>
        <p>Arguably the best part of the Rockets' number 3 overall draft selection, according to Summer League, was his defensive ability. Based on what we saw, he can shuffle his feet to keep up with faster players and has no difficulty defending at the rim. When the Rockets are no longer the worst defense in the league next season, most of the credit will be attributed to Smith. Many other players will contribute to this as well, but he will be the piece that most people will point to and say that’s why their defense got better.</p>
        <p>Additionally, other top prospects like Jaden Ivey, Paolo Banchero, and Keegan Murray will have to play behind more players on their respective teams. Murray should start but is the 4th option behind Fox, Sabonis, and Barnes on the Kings. Ivey has to compete with Jalen Duren from his same class and Cade Cunningham will still be the primary ball-handler. Banchero has the most opportunity playing alongside Cole Anthony and Jalen Suggs, but recently the NBA has stopped giving out rookie of the year awards to #1 overall picks.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Smith has something to prove. Unlike the rest of the top picks, he was the only one that shockingly fell from his mocked position. Similar to Jalen Green last season, he wants to show the other teams that he should've been taken number 1, which will motivate him even more. The entire team has something to prove next season, and Smith will be a huge part of it. His usage rate, efficiency, and numbers have a great chance to be the highest among eligible rookies and those are things that can earn him the award.</p>
