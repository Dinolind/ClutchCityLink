        <h5>A Recap of John Wall’s Tenure With the Houston Rockets. Was it All Bad?</h5>
        <p>John Wall’s time as a Houston Rocket has come and gone, so now it’s time to look at everything he accomplished as a part of the organization. It’s definitely been a journey of ups and downs, but Wall will certainly be missed by many. The years he was here will be remembered when the Rockets hopefully win a championship in the future. It’s players like him that always end up on rebuilding teams due to their large contracts, and we see the same cycle every few years. Once a player becomes overpaid, they have to go to a team that can afford their large salary. This usually means said team is unable to compete until that contract expires. More often than not, assets have to be moved for another organization to absorb that salary, and we saw that to an extent with Wall. He is a former top point-guard who has become a solid bench option, and that is a big part of why his time in Houston was cut short.</p>
        <h2>2020-2021 Season</h2>
        <p>The Rockets acquired Wall back in December of 2020 when they sent the wizards Russell Westbrook in exchange for him as well as a 2023 lottery-protected first round pick. To many Rockets fans at the time, this trade seemed like a steal. Yes, Wall had been injured for over a year up to that point, but at their respective peaks, many would argue that he was a better player than Westbrook. Around this time, workout clips had been released that showed what Wall was capable of when facing off against other NBA talent, and, as you would imagine, fans became pretty excited. Lots of people were convinced a backcourt of Wall and Harden would be unstoppable, until it wasn’t. Only about a month later, James Harden was traded away in what is still considered one of the biggest moves in recent NBA history.</p>
        <p>Thus, Wall and the Rockets had to move into a new direction. Victor Oladipo became his new running mate as the Rockets started off the post-Harden era with a 6-game winning streak, which ended in dramatic fashion against the Thunder without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Oladipo was moved by the deadline, and Wall carried out the season as the primary ball handler before being shut down for the remainder of it on April 24th. He ultimately posted averages of 20.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.8 blocks per night in about 32 minutes. These numbers were only a slight dip from the end of his time in Washington, but considering he was the number 1 option on a terrible team, not very many people were impressed. Nobody knew it at the time, but April 23, 2021 was the last game John Wall would ever play for the franchise.</p>
        <h2>2021-2022 Season</h2>
        <p>On November 26, 2021, the Rockets and John Wall mutually agreed that he would sit out for the entire upcoming season. Many were questioning why you would pay a guy close to $50 million to sit on the bench, but this decision was arrived at for a multitude of reasons. The first was that John Wall was unwilling to be a backup. The Rockets determined that they wanted to start KPJ and Jalen Green for their youth, and not give minutes to a guy that wasn’t going to be there long term. This obviously didn’t sit right with John Wall. Another possible reason was that the Rockets wanted to lose more games to earn higher lottery odds. Clearly, the team was, and still is, in a rebuilding phase, and having John Wall play a decent amount of minutes in most games would’ve almost certainly added to their win total.</p>
        <p>The NBA in its current state does not reward teams in the middle, so it made the most sense for the Rockets to lose as many games as possible. Wall did not help this agenda. Lastly, both parties didn’t want to risk further injury while playing in games that didn’t matter. It would’ve been terrible to see Wall end his career after another gruesome injury, and it wasn’t like he was going to lead the team to a playoff appearance anyways. As a result, Wall essentially became the highest paid assistant coach in NBA history. There were some talks of a potential buyout, but there was simply too much money he would have to give up. The former all-star just didn’t fit the timeline whatsoever, and was stuck on the worst team in the league, instead of trying to win a ring.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The off-season rolled around and, with only one year left on his contract, John Wall and the Rockets officially reached a $40.9 million buyout agreement. Pretty soon after, he signed with the Clippers in hopes of competing for a championship next season. Finally, the saga that followed giving Chris Paul a $160 million extension, had ended. Although his time here in Houston was limited, that was probably better for both sides overall. It wouldn’t call trading for Wall a mistake, but more of a misjudgment of where the franchise was heading. The fact that an uninjured max player sat out an entire season with the team’s blessing is a crazy occurrence. When we look back, John Wall may be the face of the times when the Rockets were terrible,  but many will forget how they ended up in that situation. I’m glad that the John Wall era is over, but who knows where the team would be had it never happened.</p>
