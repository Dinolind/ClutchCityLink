        <h1>Does Jalen Green Have a Legitimate Chance At Being An All-star Next Season</h1>
        <p>Is there really a chance for Jalen Green to make the NBA all-star game next season? Some enthusiastic Rockets’ fans may already be considering him a lock, while others remain cautiously optimistic. If he continues to perform at the level we saw from him at the end of last season, it may be possible. This year, he is for-sure going to be the #1 option on a team that has a bright, young core, which may just push him over the edge. Plus, with superior teammates around him, the Rockets could win just enough games to remain relevant. Here is a list of every Western Conference player I expect to undoubtedly appear in the All-Star game if no injuries were to occur:</p>
        <h4>Stephen Curry</h4>
        <h4>Ja Morant</h4>
        <h4>LeBron James</h4>
        <h4>Kawhi Leonard</h4>
        <h4>Nikola Jokic</h4>
        <h4>Anthony Davis</h4>
        <h4>Luka Doncic</h4>
        <h4>Devin Booker</h4>
        <h4>Karl-Anthony Towns</h4>
        <h4>Rudy Gobert</h4>
        <h4>Damian Lillard (1st of 2 final reserves)</h4>
        <p>With the recent departures of Western Conference guards, like Dejonte Murray and Donovan Mitchell, the likelihood has certainly increased. However, it’s not going to be easy. Ja Morant, Stephen Curry, Devin Booker, and Luka Doncic are the heavy favorites to occupy the 4 guard spots from the Western Conference, and barring an injury or something crazy happening, I don’t see Jalen Green outplaying any of them. He’s going to be good, but not lead-a-team-to-the-playoffs good. So, that leaves the 2 reserve spots set aside for any position as his main opportunity. Below is a list of guys I predict will be fighting for these two spots next year along with their current situations.</p>
        <h2>Chris Paul</h2>
        <p>Yes, Chris Paul is old, 37 to be exact, but he is still one of the top guards out west. Last season, he was the second best player on a Suns team that won an NBA-best, 64 games. Being a former Rocket, we both know what CP3 is capable of and why he is still widely considered a part of the league's top talent. However, there’s always a chance that this year could mark the beginning of his downfall. Plus, voters may just want somebody new with a flashy skillset, in Jalen Green, rather than the methodical Chris Paul we’ve seen for nearly 20 years.</p>
        <h2>Paul George</h2>
        <p>Coming off a season riddled with injuries, Paul George is either going to have a bounce back year or slowly lose his all-star reputation. The Clippers certainly have the talent to become title contenders, and Paul George is a big part of that. If he can return to his former self, there is no question that he will be an all-star, but that is a big if. Plus, George will have to adjust to no longer being the number 1 option on his team with Kawhi Leonard set to make his return next season. He is now on the wrong side of thirty and has yet to win a championship, so unless the Clippers emerge as a top team, Jalen Green may have a shot at earning a spot in the All-Star game over him.</p>
        <h2>Zion Williamson & Brandon Ingram</h2>
        <p>I’m grouping these two players together because whoever becomes the Pelicans top guy next season will be Jalen Green’s toughest competition between the two. The Pelicans have a chance to make some noise next season with Zion coming back, but I really don’t think they can beat out other teams like the Clippers, Warriors, Nuggets, or Suns. Neither of these players are going to be the type that takes all the shots, like Jalen Green is, which may hinder both of their chances. The Pelicans simply have too many quality NBA players, that if they aren't a top team come February, it would be hard to justify putting someone in who might not have the same statistical output of the Rockets’ guard.</p>
        <h2>Andrew Wiggins</h2>
        <p>Is what Andrew Wiggins did last season a fluke? Or is he really going to be the second best player on the Warriors going forward. Call me a biased Rockets’ fan, but I just don’t see how Wiggins retains his position with players like Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and Zion Williamson returning from injury. Heck, I would even pick Anthony Edwards to make it over Wiggins. He’s just not going to have the same role as he did last season. The Warriors’ young guys, like Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga, are going to need more touches, and Klay Thompson has now had a full off-season to build himself back up to his former glory. I extremely doubt that the Warriors will get 3 all-star selections again next season, and there’s a decent chance they won’t even get two.</p>
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        <p>Does Jalen Green theoretically have a chance? Yes. Is it realistic based on what we’ve seen so far? No. As much as I would love to see it, there are simply too many things that would have to go right. Several key players would have to get injured, Jalen Green would have to carry this team to at least the 10th seed, and he would likely have to put up some ridiculous numbers while doing so. Along with the players mentioned above, people like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Cade Cunningham, Draymond Green, and Deandre Ayton could all have a chance as well. That being said, there’s basically zero chance that Jalen Green never makes the all-star team; it just might not be next season. However, I’m not ruling it out entirely yet because it’s never good to doubt your own players, but if I were you I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>
