        <h1>How Can Stephen Silas Secure His Head-Coaching Spot Going Forward</h1>
        <p>To say the least, Stephen Silas’ tenure with the Houston Rockets has gotten off to a rocky start over the past two seasons. Many fans were calling for his head during the 20-game losing streak during February and March of last year. Nonetheless, he is still the head coach of the Rockets. So, what must he do next season in order to improve his standing among enthusiasts and the organization. Continue reading to find out. Although we have seen a lot of games, it’s hard to evaluate Silas up to this point because of the circumstances he was given. Nobody expected the Rockets to be competitive after trading away James Harden for a bunch of picks, so you can’t exactly blame him for that. He’s also had to work around many injuries and players coming in and out of the lineup, which doesn’t help either. So, it’s no surprise that the 2022-2023 season is going to be a pivotal one for Stephen Silas’ career.</p>
        <h2>Player Development</h2>
        <p>Although Stephen Silas wasn’t brought in as a developmental coach, having the rookies from last season take a step is going to be the most important goal for next season. We’ve already seen this to an extent, with substantial improvement from some of the guys over the course of last season, namely Jalen Green and Josh Christopher. However, they’ve now had an off-season to workout and improve their talents, and hopefully Stephen Silas has been a big part of that. This upcoming season will show whether he is committed to what it takes to successfully complete a rebuild, or reveal that he is just using his position to gain experience before getting another job for a playoff team.</p>
        <p>If, say, 20 games into the season, it becomes evident that little progress has been made as far as helping guys live up to their potential, that could be detrimental to Silas’ job. It may be more beneficial in the long run to bring in/promote a coach that is known for helping players grow, like Scott Brooks. As alluded to before, Silas was hired in hopes of leading James Harden and Russell Westbrook to the Finals, not to lose games on purpose to improve lottery odds. He may just not be what the Rockets need right now, unless we see some changes going forward. Luckily, he’s almost forced to give the young prospects more minutes now that a good majority of the vets from the past few seasons have moved on to other teams.</p>
        <h2>Fit the Team Needs</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, the coach should fit what the players want and need, not the other way around. If Stephen Silas isn’t the type of guy the recent 1st round picks need, then I’m sorry, but he gotta go. That being said, the opinion of the Rockets’ coach, to this point, remains pretty high among players. However, we don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes. Nothing suggests that there is any tension, but we don’t know for sure. Silas needs to prove next season that he’s the guy that can mentor the players under him while having the team win more games. If not, we may see the franchise bring in a new coach in the next few years to elevate them to the next level, similar to what we saw with the Warriors and Steve Kerr.</p>
        <p>For example, if Jalen Green develops a similar play style to James Harden, where it’s iso after iso with shooters spacing the floor, it may clash with what Silas wants to do. In this situation, I would say that Silas either needs to learn how to coach in that system, or the Rockets will find someone else that can. However, there needs to be a balance with that sorta thing. The coach is there for a reason, to organize how the team plays. If everybody has free will to do whatever they want, it likely won’t end well. The bottom line is that star players win games in the NBA Finals, not the coach, and the organizational hierarchy should reflect as such.</p>
        <h2>Unite the Players</h2>
        <p>Lastly, we need to see him turn this group into a team. There were countless moments last season where it looked like the Rockets just picked 5 random guys off the street and made them play together. With very little cohesion, winning games became more difficult. The old saying, “defense wins championships” is not “defensive players win championships” because in this case the defensive whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Just because we will have better defensive players next season in Jabari Smith Jr. and Tari Eason, does not automatically mean the Defensive will get better. That job lies with Stephen Silas and the rest of the coaching staff.</p>
        <p>This is also true on the offensive end. Isolation after isolation is just simply not as effective as a motion offense with high assist numbers across the board. We all witnessed that firsthand in the 2018 Western Conference Finals. Fortunately, this has been one of Silas' strong-suits so far. We’ll just have to see if he can replicate it with an entirely new group of guys. One thing for sure is that a team cannot win unless they learn how to play together. Just look at the Brooklyn Nets, who have all of the talent in the world, but have come up short every year due to a lack of chemistry. The Rockets do have some time to accomplish this, but the sooner they figure out if Stephan Silas can be the one to unify this roster, the better.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Having two consecutive seasons with the worst record in the league is not the start Stephen Silas wanted for his head-coaching career, but it was what the Rockets needed to do. Now that they have accumulated some talent, they shouldn’t be last in the standings by a wide margin again, and if the Rockets are, I expect Stephen Silas to be sent packing immediately. The team should hopefully be the 3rd or 4th worst team next season, to still get a high lottery pick, but not become the laughing stock of the league. Plus, it’s not like losing the most games has got them the #1 overall pick on either occasion. Overall, having a good coach can greatly improve the odds of winning a championship, while a bad one can make a team significantly underperform, and Stephen Silas is going to show next year what one he is going to be.
