        <h1>An Update On Jabari Smith Jr. 2 Months Into His Career With Houston</h1>
        <p>“With the 3rd pick in the 2022 NBA draft the Houston Rockets Select, Jabar Smith Jr. from Auburn University” - Adam Silver. It feels like just a few days ago that those words were spoken; yet it has been nearly 6 months. Time really does fly by. There are still many great moments over, hopefully, a very long career for Smith in Houston, but we now have a decent amount to look at. Anyways, now being two months into Smith’s rookie season, it’s the right moment to analyze what has happened so far, and what we can look forward to in the future.</p>
        <h2>Jabari Smith Jr. So Far</h2>
        <p>Let’s just say that Jabari Smith Jr. so far has been pretty average. Certainly not outstanding, but not terrible either. It must have been a shock to him on draft night when his name was not called first, that honor ultimately going to Paolo Banchero. However, we are glad to have him in Houston. Changing the top pick last minute is something that almost never happens, but it did land us a star in the making. Paolo Banchero, who was supposed to end up in Houston, is having an amazing first season by all standards, and is currently leading the key award race by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>In 28 games this season, Smith has averaged 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 0.7 assists, 0.9 blocks, and 0.4 steals in about 30 minutes per night. As a rookie, that’s not too bad, but nowhere near a Rookie of the Year nomination. His efficiency has dropped as well from when he was in college. The #3 overall pick shot 43% from the field and 42% from 3 at Auburn, compared to 38% from the field and 35% for 3 in the NBA. Not very promising from a fan’s perspective, even though transitioning between the 2 can be understandably difficult. We were spoiled by the emergence of Jalen Green last year, so it’s tough to watch someone not live up to the immense amount of hype.</p>
        <h2>Jabari Smith Jr. Going Forward</h2>
        <p>We all knew going into the draft that Banchero was more of a first-option-on-a-team type guy, whereas Bari was an excellent complementary piece on a championship roster. This all ended up working out because the Rockets already have Jalen Green, who appears poised to lead Houston to several championships in the future. I also think the shooting concerns should be remedied with time. Maybe the 3-point line being further away or the constant pressure of everybody watching him is just messing with Smith’s head. We’ve also seen very encouraging defensive flashes, even earning him the nickname “locksmith”.</p>
        <p>I’m hoping to see some steady improvement out of Smith throughout the remainder of the games. Maybe he’ll go on a tear in the last month before summer, just like Green did last season. It’s not like he’s been awful, still being ranked as the 6th best rookie; I guess the expectations were just way too high. The Rocket’s developmental program has shown enough, though, for me not to doubt their capabilities either. Once the team starts actively trying to win games, instead of rebuilding, we will truly see what Jabari can do. The frame and skillset that he has does not come by very often, and the player he can potentially be, is the reason most scouts placed him at the top of their boards.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>It may be disheartening to see people like Jaden Ivey, Bennedict Mathurin, and Keegan Murry  outplaying Smith to this point, but I encourage you to stay positive. Revisionist history is a cruel phenomenon. I promise you the Timberwolves are mad at themselves nearly everyday for not picking Stephen Curry when they had not only one chance, but two. Instead, taking Jonny Flynn, who hasn’t played in the league for over a decade. Just give it some time and things will work out. Jabari Smith Jr. ’s defensive talent is unmatched and his ability to shoot a 3 over basically anybody is incredible. His first 2 months have been full of ups and downs, but there’s no reason to panic. The Houston Rockets are still well on their way to winning a championship with Smith as a franchise cornerstone.
