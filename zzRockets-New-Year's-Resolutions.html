        <h1>New Year's Resolutions That the Houston Rockets Should Follow In 2023</h1>
        <p>The New Year is upon us and the Houston Rockets are not off to a great start. They are currently on a streak where they’ve lost 9 out of the last 10 games, and the schedule doesn’t seem to get any easier for a while. There’s inner turmoil throughout the organization, and this period of time could be a real turning point in determining the success of this rebuild. The first thing that needs to happen is trading away Eric Gordon, no questions asked. If you want to look at some possible mock trades or understand more about the situation, click <a href="zzEric Gordon Trade 2022 Update.html">here</a>. Beyond that, a popular tradition is to improve something when the new year rolls around, in the spirit of the holiday, here’s some things the team should write down for their resolutions.</p>
        <h2>Ball Movement</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I am sick and tired of watching Kevin Porter Jr. dribble the ball for 20 seconds and then throw up a wild shot for the final few possessions in a close game. I’m sorry, but you’re not James Harden. This statement goes for everyone else, too. Stop standing in the corners and waiting for a pass. Move around, make the defense tired, and get a quality open look. That also means shooting the ball if you’re open. The biggest advantage this roster has is their athleticism, and they should be using that to their advantage. Push the pace in transition, hustle on defense, and keep moving around. What happened to the “electric” culture we’re supposed to be building? I can tell you for sure that it’s not going as it should.</p>
        <h2>Limiting Turnovers</h2>
        <p>It’s great to say that everyone needs to share the ball more, but usually that comes with more turnovers. This needs to be addressed as well. It’s extremely difficult to win an NBA game as it is, and even more difficult if you essentially give the other team the ball on a quarter of your possessions. For example, against the New York Knicks on December 31st, the Rockets had a total of 24 turnovers, which equated to 37 points for the Knicks. No wonder they lost. The Rockets led the league in turnovers per game last season and are doing it yet again this year. If that doesn’t tell you we need a new ball handler, then I don’t know what will. That fact that we play a ton of isolation ball and still commit this many turnovers is not acceptable whatsoever for a team that needs desperately to improve.</p>
        <h2>Fix The Rotation</h2>
        <p>Can someone give me one good reason why Stephen Silas needs to run a 3-man center rotation? No, you can’t, because it doesn’t make any sense. Usman Garuba and Alperen Sengun have outplayed Bruno Fernando consistently, and should be the only two guys getting minutes at the 5. Apologies to Bruno Fernando; I’m sure you’re a great guy and teammate, but you need to find a new city to play for. I don’t understand how this clearly obvious issue still exists. Furthermore, Boban Marjanovic should not be getting minutes if one of those 3 guys is out. I feel comfortable with Sengun for about 32 minutes and Garuba for the other 16. That’s it.</p>
        <p>Also, the guard minutes are in shambles too. Josh Christopher has only played more than 5 minutes in a singular game one time in basically the past month. This needs to be addressed immediately. Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nix, and Eric Gordon all need to stop receiving playing time in favor of Tyty Washington Jr. And Josh Christopher. Deal Eric Gordon, send Nix back to the g-league, and only play Mathew’s when there’s an injury. It’s as simple as that. The guard rotation should be KPJ and Jalen Green as starters, with Christopher and Washington off the bench. Don’t make it anymore complicated.</p>
        <h2>Establish Player Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>The team’s player hierarchy is also all over the place. It’s impossible to tell who is currently the third option on the team. Is it Alperen Sengun, Eric Gordon, or Kenyon Martin Jr? No one knows, and I think that's a real problem. Just look around the league at some championship contenders: the Bucks have Jrue Holiday, the Nets have Ben Simmons, and the Nuggets have Michael Porter Jr. It’s clear there has to be a pecking order for a successful team and right now there isn’t.</p>
        <p>I’d even argue that Jabari Smith Jr. should be the third guy for the Rockets. He was the projected number 1 overall pick in last year’s draft, and is now unfortunately being treated as a 3 and D wing who stands around in the corner. I’m worried about his development if changes don’t occur. Everybody knows he’s capable of much more and just isn’t being utilized properly. The franchise has all the pieces, and is just failing to bring it all together in a coherent way. I think the fault for that should again lie with Stephen Silas, but there may be things going on behind the scenes that we just don’t know about.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I’m sorry if this felt sort of like a rant, though, I just have to call it out how it is. Eric Gordon has opened a lot of fans' eyes by saying that there’s been no improvement over the course of the season. While I don’t agree with that statement entirely, I do understand where he’s coming from. Changes need to be made and questions need to be answered. I know we’re supposed to still be losing games, but I’m more concerned with how we’re losing them. The Rockets have not been tough to play against at all, which contradicts exactly what Silas’ plan was coming into media day. Hope is still there for everything to turn around, but there are too many discouraging signs that are causing it to disappear.</p>
