        <h1>Is It Time to Give Up On the Kevin Porter Jr. At Point Guard Experiment?</h1>
        <p>Ever since Kevin Porter Jr. was acquired by the Houston Rockets back on January 21, 2021, he has been encouraged to make a position change to point guard. This was because Porter had to play alongside Jalen Green, who is an unquestioned shooting guard, in the starting lineup. While we have seen flashes of him at the 1 being good for the team, a majority of the time, it’s been lackluster. Is it time for this test to end? Should we give up on KPJ and Green in the starting lineup altogether? These questions have begun to arise over the past few weeks as it has become clear that the experiment is still not working. The argument for both sides is outlined below along with my opinions on the situation.</p>
        <h2>It’s Still Too Soon</h2>
        <p>KPJ has been a shooting guard his whole life. Now he’s expected to magically become a facilitator in just over a season of reps. Of course, it’s going to take a lot more time than that for him to become an effective point guard at the NBA level. There’s a reason that players who can play multiple positions are so valuable to teams; it’s not easy to do. Besides, both he and Jalen Green have seen their stats improve between this season and 2021. Just give it some more time and everything will start to come together. Plus, point guards are notorious for taking a while to develop. Just look at Kyle Lowry, who spent 10 years in the league before making the All-Star game 6 consecutive times. I know that seems like a long time to wait, but it could be worth it.</p>
        <p>Additionally, it’s not like you really have another option. Neither Daishen Nix or Tyty Washington Jr. is fit to be a starter at the current stage of their respective careers, and even then, both of them are not considered “true” point guards. The other option would be trading Porter, but the issue with that is he just signed a 4-year extension this offseason. I’m not even sure if he’s even able to be traded, or if the organization would deal him away less than a full season after offering him a long-term deal. Maybe Stephen Silas can try out some different players in the starting backcourt, but trading for a win-now facilitator would just be plain stupid at this point in time. However, I don’t think the Rockets gave KPJ almost $80 million dollars over 4 seasons to come off the bench.</p>
        <h2>End It Now</h2>
        <p>If it hasn’t worked to this point, it’s probably not going to work out anytime soon. The Rockets just don’t have 5+ years to waste on the chance that KPJ may eventually figure out how to play the 1. To put it bluntly, he’s a shooting guard, always has been, and always will be. Stop trying to play him out of position and go find somebody else. It’s become clear that Jalen Green plays better next to a playmaker rather than a scoring threat, and our primary goal is to have him develop to his full potential. The experiment has failed and it’s time to move on. Stop wasting time on something we know isn’t going to work. It could make more sense to move KPJ to the bench and find a replacement. I understand it’s sad, but tough decisions have to be made.</p>
        <p>Also, the way his contract is structured, the Rockets can just release Porter at the end of the season with no repercussions. That’s because this season is the only one that is fully guaranteed. We should get rid of him and use that money to find someone who fits the system better in free agency. Why waste time on trying to develop someone when you can basically get the fully developed version on the open market for about the same amount of money. The Rockets have all this cap-space and need to spend it, so this could be the perfect opportunity. A move like this could propel the franchise into an above .500 team, and it would be a big waste to not make a move and be stuck with something that doesn’t function on offense or defense.</p>
        <h2>My Stance</h2>
        <p>I say just let it ride as is until the end of the season and go from there. There’s not much you can do right now, anyways, that makes any logical sense. Once we get to that point and there’s still no improvement, then I say let KPJ walk and bring in someone else via the draft or free agency. It’s not like we’d be losing out on much because Porter was acquired for a top-55 protected pick that probably hasn’t, or ever will, convey to the Cavaliers. It was fun while it lasted, but we need to recognize when it’s time to move on. However, if there is noticeable growth in chemistry and cohesion between Green and KPJ, then we can hold onto him. Essentially, Porter is in a minutes battle between him and all the potential options that can replace him across the league. If the Rockets get Scoot Henderson in the draft, then that’s the problem solved right there, but if not, the decision will be a little more up in the air. As with most things, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
