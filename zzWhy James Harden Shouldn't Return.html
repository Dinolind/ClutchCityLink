        <h1>Why James Harden Shouldn't Return to Houston This Off-Season (+ Better Options)</h1>
        <p>James Harden is currently on the last guaranteed year of his contract with the Philadelphia 76ers and can become a free-agent this off-season if he chooses to decline his player option. While it remains up in the air as to whether or not he’ll decide to stay with Philadelphia, the possibility of him leaving certainly exists. Who better to sign him than his former team that is projected to have up to a whopping $72,000,000 in cap space, right? WRONG. Yes, the reunion seems like a good idea on paper, but when you take a closer look, it becomes evident that it is not the right decision to make for either side at this point in time. Below are 3 reasons why Harden should stay away from his former city this summer.</p>
        <h2>Doesn’t Fit Team/Timeline</h2>
        <p>First off, let’s get the obvious out of the way: Harden will be 34 years old by the time he would finally suit up for the Rockets again, and currently the team’s average age is around 23 without Boban Marjanovic. Considering the fact that Eric Gordon will also likely be gone soon, the difference becomes a lot greater. Teams that sign aging stars past their primes almost never work out, especially when that aging star can’t play effectively without the ball in his hands. Just look at the Clippers who signed Kawhi Leonard, the Nets who signed Kevin Durant, and the 76ers themselves with Tobias Harris. All of these guys are still effective, if not way better than that, on an NBA court, yet none of them have come close to winning a championship since joining their respective teams. All 3 teams dismantled their young cores for a big name, and it hasn’t worked.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Arizona St. shooting guard was also a massive ball-hog during his previous stint with the Rockets. He’s not as bad now due to Joel Embiid being the number 1 option in Philly, but what’s to say he won’t go back to his old ways if given the chance. Plus, what does this mean for Houston’s young players? Are they all going to be relegated to standing in the corner while Hardens essentially plays 1 on 1? I can tell you for sure that that’s not the way for them to develop their skill set or confidence on the court. It would be awful to see all of these years of tanking go to waste because the franchisee brings back the ball-dominant guard. One of the major positives for this group is their ability to share the ball; let’s not ruin it.</p>
        <h2>Can’t Win Championships</h2>
        <p>When asked about James Harden’s high usage rate and production, Kobe Bryant himself said, “I don't think that style is ever going to win championships.” If one of the NBA’s all-time greats doesn’t believe in Harden, then why should we? The 10x All-Star will just take over and the team will be stuck in mediocrity until he retires or his numbers start to decline. We definitely don’t want to end up like the Washington Wizards, who have been just decent for what feels like forever. Harden needs to chase a ring to submit his spot in NBA history. He should be a hall-of-famer, no doubt, but he’s also likely to never take home an NBA title. We all know he wants to win, and there’s about 10 different teams where has a better chance of that than in Houston.</p>
        <h2>Better Options Available</h2>
        <p>Lastly, there’s just better options available. Having cap-space is a great thing because it allows you to choose which players you actually want. Without any money, teams are forced into overpaying the people on their roster to prevent losing them without being able to find a replacement. It’s just the way the cap works for this league. If we sign Harden now, for say, a 4 year/$100 million contract, then we are pretty much stuck long-term. The Rockets need to go after somebody younger who can be extended for a longer period of time after their initial contract. It’s just not worth it to invest that kind of money in someone who is old and isn’t the right fit. There are plenty of other guys to think about.</p>
        <p>For example, Myles Turner, Gary Trent Jr., and Jerami Grant all fit the criteria way better. It’s realistically possible for the Rockets to have enough room to sign all 3, can you even imagine? The team’s depth would be one of the best in the league, no questions asked, while having 3 high lottery picks as building blocks. You just can’t ask for any more. That scenario is what the Boston Celtics, the best team in the league record-wise, currently have, except it’s more. Envision a 10-man rotation with a starting lineup of Scoot Henderson, Jalen Green, Jerami Grant, Jabari Smith Jr., Alperen Sengun and Myles Turner, Gary Trent Jr., Kevin Porter Jr., Tari Eason, and Usman Garuba off the bench. That looks absolutely insane on paper, yet it can actually happen. Now add Harden into the mix and take away those 3 pieces, and the correct choice becomes clear.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Dear Rafael Stone, do NOT offer Harden a contract when/if he becomes available. I know fans are desperate to start winning games, just like me, but that is not the right move to make for the short-term or long-term. I have confidence in the front office to not make any ridiculous decisions, and even more confidence that Harden needs to go somewhere else. Maybe bring him in when he’s like 38 or older after his next contract to ride the bench and win a ring, but not anytime soon. He made it clear that he wanted to leave Houston, and he shouldn’t get to come back when things are starting to turn around. I am thankful for the time he spent in this city, and the championship we almost won, but that chapter is over. It’s time to move on, and think with our heads and not our hearts. There’s no reason to go all-in on a rebuild and end up with a new variation of the same team centered around the same guy who couldn’t win.</p>
