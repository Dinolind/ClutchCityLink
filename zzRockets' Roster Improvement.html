        <h1>4 Ways the Houston Rockets’s Roster is Going to Improve This Off-season</h1>
        <p>Next season is when the Rockets want to start being competitive again, so what exactly needs to happen for that to become a reality? After this year, there’s no incentive for the team to lose anymore because of the fact that their first round pick is owed to the OKC Thunder. It is notoriously difficult to flip from being one of the worst teams in the league to a legitimate contender, and even harder to do it in just 1 season. Fortunately, the Rockets are in a great position to make it happen. They just need to finish the final year of this rebuild correctly and ensure success when the time comes.</p>
        <h2>Free-Agent Signings</h2>
        <p>It’s no secret the Rockets are going to have a huge amount of cap space this summer. However, there aren’t going to be very many top free agents to spend it on. Kyrie Irving is too unreliable, Khris Middleton likely isn’t leaving the Bucks, and nobody else available is really an all-star type player, except James Harden. If Harden finds himself back in Houston, that certainly would be something to see. I wouldn’t say that I want it to happen unless Harden isn’t going to be the ball-hog we all know him as, from his time here before. Also, I just don’t know that the relationship between him and the organization can be mended to a point where the front office wants to give a ton of money.</p>
        <p>That being said, there are still a lot of great options in the middle tier. Guys like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, and Caris LeVert all serve as interesting players to take a look at. We have a lot of money to spend, so we might as well spend it. That may come in the form of 2 or 3 guys that can be role players rather than another star alongside, hopefully, Jabari Smith Jr. or Jalen Green. Honestly, though, I would prefer this. The era of super teams is officially over, and having too many former number 1 options hasn’t worked for a while. If we can just get some solid rotation pieces, that would go a long way in improving our overall success next season.</p>
        <h2>The NBA Draft</h2>
        <p>The Houston Rockets are going to be one of the worst teams in basketball yet again, which comes along with the prize of a top pick in a draft that is absolutely loaded. You know the names by now: Victor Wembenyama, Scoot Henderson, the Thompson twins, and more. It’s a near certainty that the team is going to add another future stud in June. That will make it 3 top prospects in a row for the organization in back-to-back-to-back years. The last time we saw that happen was with the 76ers, and even though one of them hasn’t panned out, they are still one of the top teams in the NBA. The Rockets should be able to replicate that process, and potentially do it a lot better.</p>
        <h2>Player Improvement</h2>
        <p>While next season we will have at least 1 rookie from the NBA draft, a majority of the players in the lineup will have had experience at the NBA level. Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun will hopefully take a 3rd year jump, and KPJ will have had plenty of time at the point guard position. Plus, the rookies we have now will all have a full season under their belt. In theory, this means everybody will be better, making the team better as a whole. This is the NBA and that may not happen exactly, but I have very high hopes that it will. Just look at how players in their third seasons like Anthony Edwards, Lamelo Ball, and James Wiseman have all improved a lot from their first year. The same should happen for Jalen Green, which means good will come for the Rockets.</p>
        <h2>A New Coach?</h2>
        <p>I think that Stephan Silas is slowly beginning to lose favor with many of the fans. Some of his decisions seem odd or just downright stupid at times, and we haven’t seen a lot of the motion offense that was promised when he was brought it. This is the last season of his contract, unless the organization chooses to pick up the option for next year. That could mean the end of Silas’ time in Houston. He has now had 3 disappointing seasons in a row, and hasn’t been what everybody wants him to be. It may be too early to say that he’ll be gone as soon as possible, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened. The team wants to shift in a new direction and that may be facilitated by a new coach.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Next season is going to be a lot more pivotal than this one is. If the Rockets are still terrible, then some major changes are going to happen. We need to start winning games and get back to the playoffs. It is also when we will finally reap the rewards of all of the losses. Unfortunately, there is still the possibility that everything fails. That would be detrimental to the long-term plan, but we can’t ignore that it could happen. I do think, though, we are more likely to start winning. Maybe I’m just being biased and optimistic, but I really don’t know how we would be absolutely terrible yet again. The Rockets just have too many things that would have to go wrong. With everything being said, I can’t wait to watch it all unfold.</p>
