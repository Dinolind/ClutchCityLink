        <h1>Analyzing the Shooting Struggles That the Rockets Are Currently Facing</h1>
        <p>The lack of shooting ability the Houston Rockets have displayed over this season is, to say the least, concerning. Clearly, something isn’t working. We were supposed to see improved efficiency across the board, yet the opposite, in fact, appears to be the case. At first I thought it may just have been a stretch of bad luck, but now that we’re almost halfway through the season, I’m beginning to worry. In this era of the NBA, the ability to hit shots is more important than ever, and it’s almost impossible to win games without it. In fact, 3-point attempts are currently at an all-time high, and the reality is becoming that you have to adapt or never find success.</p>
        <p>All stats referenced are courtesy of: <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/">Teamrankings.com</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/"> Espn.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA.com</a></p>
        <h2>What’s Really Going Wrong?</h2>
        <p>Right now, the Rockets are currently ranked dead last in overall team shooting percentage, bottom 3 in 3-point percentage, and bottom 3 again in true shooting percentage. That’s especially not good when considering they were a lot closer to the middle of the pack just last season. The team is also only hitting 76% of their free throws, and is one of the worst when it comes to effective field goal percentage, which takes into account the difficulty and distance of the shot attempts. It’s shockingly bad, honestly. Even just watching the games, there are so many open looks that just don’t drop. I will give credit to Eric Gordon, though, because he seems like the only person who can consistently put the ball in the net when the defense stops guarding him.</p>
        <p>The truly sad part is that the shooting was actually supposed to be better this year. Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun, and even Eric Gordon have all shot considerably worse from 3-point range when their numbers were expected to improve, or at the bare minimum, stay the same. That’s basically the entire starting lineup outside of Jabari Smith Jr., who has perhaps been the most disappointing of them all. Smith was labeled as a knock-down shooter heading into the draft, shooting 42% from 3 on almost 6 attempts per game. Since then, his percentage has dropped to just 32%. I’ve never seen anything like it besides maybe the Markelle Fultz situation. That stat puts him in the bottom 15 eligible players for 3-point shooting across the league, and is definitely worrying as a fan.</p>
        <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
        <p>The obvious solution is that more reps are needed and the issue will resolve itself eventually, but that statement is omitting several other key factors. I’m still hoping that Smith can turn things around, but beyond that we need to generate more quality looks and actually make them. These are NBA players we’re talking about and they need to be held accountable when they mess up. I think within the organization there’s not enough pressure or expectations for anyone to improve. If this level is acceptable, then why would anyone bother putting in the work and start making progress. I do believe that everyone is a hard worker, though, so maybe it just falls back on the coaching staff for the way practices are structured.</p>
        <p>Another opinion is that a “true” point guard is needed. While that might be the case, the eye test and numbers suggest otherwise. The Rockets are around middle of the pack when it comes to the amount of 3-pointers they take that are considered open, yet they are in the bottom 4 when it comes to percentage. They are second worst when it comes to overall percentage on open shots. That means that open looks are generated at a decent rate, but they are very rarely converted on. This suggests that the lack of a facilitator may not actually be a problem and that it’s more about the shooting. Another point to add to my argument of why James Harden is not right for this team in its current construction. I guess the answer is really just as simple as practicing open shots and forgoing the bad ones; however, I do know that’s easier said than done.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I really don’t know what’s happened. There could be a lack of motivation, an extreme case of bad luck, or maybe it has something to do with players regressing in that category. It’s probably a combination of a number of factors and we may never know the true answer. Jabari Smith Jr. was supposed to save this team from 3-point range and in fact has done the opposite, ironically. There’s nothing really else to it. Maybe the Rockets are just forever cursed by their efficiency. Changes may need to be made to the roster because this cannot continue. Shooting is the most valuable commodity in this league, and it’s very disheartening to see Houston struggle with it so much. There is still time for everyone to grow and develop, so I’m not pressing the panic button just yet. I am going to watch this, though, because I was honestly surprised by how bad everything has gotten</p>
