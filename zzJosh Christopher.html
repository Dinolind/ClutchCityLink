        <h1>What Does Josh Christopher’s Role Look Like on The Houston Rockets Going Forward?</h1>
        <p>Josh Christopher certainly had an impressive rookie campaign last season, posting averages of 7.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.9 steals, and 0.2 blocks per game despite being the 4th rookie the Rockets selected in the 2021 NBA draft. However, the question that is yet to be answered is, “what’s next?.” As everyone knows, there are bound to be expectations placed on young players to show development each season. Those who repeatedly improve become the stars of the league, while those who are content with their current abilities, well, end up like Andrew Wiggins before he was traded to the Warriors.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Christopher is known for his work ethic and has a strong desire to grow as a player. It takes an extreme amount of determination to be successful in the NBA and I believe he is up for the challenge. Everything that gets released describes Christopher as one of the guys who never leaves the gym, which begs the question of how much impact he will have going forward. Could he possibly work his way into a starting position or become a consistent 6th man of the year candidate? What kind of numbers can we expect from him in the coming years? All will be revealed shortly. For now, let’s recap what his career has looked like so far.</p>
        <h2>Josh Christopher in the 2021-2022 season:</h2>
        <p>Last season, we saw Josh Christopher start off in the G-league, playing alongside Usman Garuba, and pretty much force his way into the Rockets rotation after only 3 games. This proved to be the correct decision for Stephen Silas as Christopher became a focal point of the second unit and had many games where he scored more than 20 points, including a 30-point outburst against the Timberwolves on April 3rd. The Rockets’ guard proved that the potential was there for him to be a significant, long-term player. However, Christopher struggled with his passing and ability to shoot consistently from 3-point range. Although those concerns are valid, nobody should have to be, nor will be perfect in their rookie season. So, what can we hope to see from Chirstopher in the future?</p>
        <h2>Josh Christopher in the 2022-2023 season:
        </h2>
        <p>Next year will be the perfect opportunity for Josh Christopher to establish himself as a permanent member of the team going forward. Playing behind Jalen Green, I foresee him averaging about 10 points and 5 assists while improving his shooting percentages across the board. He will no longer have to be the primary ball-handler for the second unit, as that job will belong to either Daishen Nix or TyTy Washington, which will allow him to play more towards his strengths. The former McDonald’s All-American has put in a ton of work this offseason and fans will take notice. With a Kevin Porter Jr. extension looming, Christopher may find himself in a starting role before too long, and this season will be a way to gain experience while proving his value.</p>
        <h2>Josh Christopher in the 2023-2024 season:</h2>
        <p>This will be the first season where the Rockets actively try to be competitive again and Christopher could be a huge part of that. A potential comp for his projected impact in 2023-2024 would be Tyler Herro from this past season. A guard that can come off the bench and drop an easy 15-20 points, like Herro, while still being on a rookie contract is something every team should want. Luckily the Rockets will hopefully have that in Josh Christopher. Not saying he would win 6th man of the year, but with how hard he works and what his role is likely to be, it could be possible. Having a spark plug, at 6th man, is something that makes many NBA teams successful and there is no reason to believe Christopher can’t be as such by his 3rd year.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I believe the organization got an absolute steal at pick 24 and is going to be an unstoppable force 4 years down the road. We all know what happened the last time Houston acquired a score-first guard out of Arizona State, and it could happen again to a lesser extent. This upcoming year will really show everyone whether or not Christopher is here for the long haul, but as of now I am 100% on board. He is ready to make all of the teams that passed on him regret their decision by torching their defense night in and night out. These young guys are going to develop so just be patient. It’s not every season that there is a team with 7 lottery picks in the past two years, and with the likelihood of adding more next season, the Houston Rockets are going to be stacked for pretty much the next decade.
