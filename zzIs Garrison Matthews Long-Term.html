        <h1>Is Garrison Mathews Part of the Long-Term Future For the Houston Rockets?</h1>
        <p>Garrison Mathews is now in his second season with the Houston Rockets after being claimed off waivers back on October 18th, 2021 from the Boston Celtics. Now that we know what he brings to the team, it’s time to decide if he should be a part of the long-term rebuild. Several factors go into this decision. Obviously his skillset is a big part of it, but there are other things to consider like his monetary worth, timeline, and trade value. Luckily, Mathews is on a long, team-friendly contract, so the decision with him is truly up to the organization. He is guaranteed a small amount of money next season, but after that, everything is up in the air.</p>
        <h2>Garrison Mathews so far</h2>
        <p>Last season, Mathews emerged out of nowhere and had some of the biggest games of his career. He scored over 15pts 16 times in a stretch of about two months, and played upwards of 35 minutes more than a handful of times. The production he provided was a big part of the Rocket’s offense and defense last year. His 3-point shooting ability proved extremely valuable alongside Armoni Brooks when the lineup just needed a spark to get going. The shooting guard also was , and is still, willing to put his body on line when drawing charges and hustling for loose balls. It was very impressive to watch, even earning himself the nickname “Garry Bird” , modeled after the former Celtics’ legend. We all knew at the time those were empty stats on a bad team, but it was fun watching and worth mentioning.</p>
        <p>This year had been quite the opposite until just recently. Mathews was averaging just 3.8 points, 0.8 rebounds, 0.4 assists, 0.1 blocks and 0.4 steals down from 10 points, 2.9 rebounds, 1 assist, 0.4 blocks, and 0.9 steals the year prior. That’s obviously a big drop-off, but not as significant when you go based on the per 36 numbers. As a result, it may not be that he has gotten any worse, just that he is not being given as much of an opportunity. This has been an issue for pretty much the entire roster that has been here for at least a season. However, his play has picked up a bit since then, including a season-high 20-point game against the Hawks on November 25th. We’ve seen him seemingly come to life, and it has been exciting to watch. That being said, this season has not been good for his career by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
        <h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping Him</h2>
        <p>The first reason to keep Garrison Mathews as a part of the organization is that he gives the team a scoring lift off the bench. On any given night he can go off for 20 if the shots are falling and the offense is being run through him. The upside of having a guy like that on basically a minimum contract is tremendous. Shooting is the most valuable commodity in the NBA, and that happens to be what Mathews specializes in. He is also a hard worker that isn’t afraid of getting injured out on the court. His ability to hustle fits the culture of the Houston Rockets perfectly. We need lots of people who play with high energy and can keep up in transition. I would also say that his defense isn’t bad either. I don’t think his defensive ceiling is very high, but the effort he puts in makes up for it.</p>
        <p>Now for the cons. The most obvious con being that he takes up a roster spot that could be used more effectively. If he’s struggling to get consistent minutes sometimes now, what’s it’s going to be like with a more talented roster? I can tell you for sure that very few plays will be run for him, and I don’t know if he can thrive in an offense like that. Mathews is more than a guy to put in the corner, and may be able to better utilize his abilities on another team in a few years. He is also already 26 years old. While that’s not elderly by NBA terms, he doesn’t fit the timeline of the rest of the young core, whose ages range from 19-22. It may not matter much now, but it could in about 7 years when Jalen Green will be 27, whereas Mathews will be 33. If we’re trying to build for longevity, then maybe he isn’t the answer.</p>
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        <p>I would say he’s not going anywhere for a while. My guess is that Mathews will be here at least through the end of next season. I could see him being a thrown-in piece for a future trade sooner than that, but I think the organization has his value higher than what is perceived around the league. It just isn’t the time to do anything yet, but I don’t think Mathews will be on the championship roster. We just have too many guards for that to happen: Jalen Green, Kevin Porter jr., Josh Christopher, Daishen Nix, Tyty Washington jr., and Eric Gordon for the time being. I don’t think I would put Mathews over any of those guys as far as importance to the organization, meaning he won’t be on the team when tough decisions have to be made. Maybe he’ll prove me wrong, and I would love to see it, but his potential seems to have been reached. He’s fine for now as part of a rebuilding franchise, though that may not be the same case in a few years time.</p>
