        <h1>4 Free Agents the Rockets Should Look to Sign in the 2023 NBA off-season.</h1>
        <p>Next off-season is when the Rockets will look to make a big free-agent splash with their projected $60 million in cap-space. The team has been especially strategic with their recent roster moves in order to preserve the ability to land a top guy on the open market. However, it is crucial to the future of the franchise that the money is spent wisely. By the end of next year, the roster is set to be full of young talent and will need someone to take them to the next level. Hopefully that someone can come from free agency and add to the Rockets what Kevin Durant added to the Warriors just a few seasons ago.</p>
        <p>Now that the 2022 summer is basically over, the FA (Free Agent) class for next season has become more clear-cut. With only being 1 year out, it is about time to start looking at who the organization could and should get when the time comes. How next off-season goes will affect this team for probably the next 10 or so years, so it is critical that they do not mess up what has been built so far. With hopefully adding another top prospect in the 2023 draft, the ceiling will become incredibly high going forward. The last two times we’ve seen teams successfully bottom out like the Rockets were the Thunder back in the early 2010s and the 76ers about 5 years ago, and we both know that it was definitely worth it for those teams. Below is a list of potential guys they could sign who make the most sense currently.</p>
        <h2>Kyrie Irving</h2>
        <h4>Potential Contract: 5 years/245 million </h4>
        <p>While Kyrie Irving is not the safest choice, he probably is the best player, talent-wise, that the Rockets could realistically acquire. Unfortunately, that means KPJ would either be traded, allowed to sign somewhere else, or benched. However, Irving’s craftiness and floor-spacing ability make him an easy fit pretty much anywhere. Provided that he plays, his ball-handling and court vision would mesh perfectly with Jalen Green’s shot creation and athleticism. That backcourt would certainly be scary to go against. Plus, I think the irony in stealing one of Nets best players while having them still owe us all of those draft picks would be fantastic.</p>
        <h2>RJ Barrett</h2>
        <h4>Potential Contract: 5 years/185 million</h4>
        <p>RJ Barrett is a younger option than Irving that has his own unique benefits. He is going to be a restricted free-agent, but we have certainly seen crazier things have happened over the years, so I’m not going to rule him out. He would slide in at the starting small forward position, a role that will be relatively open by this point, and add another dynamic wing, who is face-paced and defensive minded, alongside Jabari Smith Jr., to this team. You can never have enough guys that know how to score, and at his current age of 22, Barrett would fit the timeline of the rest of his future teammates better than Irving.</p>
        <p>These last two options would hopefully be signed in unison if the Rockets can’t get a top free agent.</p>
        <h2>De’Andre Hunter</h2>
        <h4>Potential Contract: 4 years/80 million</h4>
        <p>De’Andre Hunter has been a solid 3-and-D role player for the Atlanta Hawks in his first three seasons, but he is still young enough that he might have the potential to take it to the next level. He would play a similar role as the one outlined for RJ Barrett above, although he is likely to be the 3rd option, or lower, on the team. Hunter may not fit the superstar mold many Rockets fans have been fantasizing about for the past few seasons, but it’s the moves around the edges that really make the difference. Plus, if they save a bit of money here, the organization would have more flexibility going forward. Hunter has the upside to be great and his floor is high enough that there's only a very slim chance the Rockets would regret acquiring him.
        </p>
        <h2>Myles Turner</h2>
        <h4>Potential Contract: 4 years/72 million</h4>
        <p>Myles Turner has seemed like the most likely person to switch teams nearly every season, and yet it still hasn’t materialized. The Rockets were even rumored to trade for Turner back in 2019, but since it didn’t happen then, it might just happen now. His fit alongside Sengun is like a match made in heaven. Turner can space the floor and protect the rim while Sengun does his usual highlight reel passes. Just imagine how much floor spacing there would be in a lineup of KPJ, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Myles Turner, and Alperen Sengun. He is the prototypical, new-age big man and the team could certainly benefit from someone like that.</p>
        <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
        <p>I have faith that the franchise will make the best move possible in next year’s free agency. Whether that means signing one of the top guys or filling out the rotation with quality role players, there is no question that the Rockets will take a big jump the following season. Unfortunately, the FA class was supposed to be absolutely loaded with talent before several extensions were given out over the past few months, but there are still plenty of quality options. My favorite is the one with RJ Barrett. A starting 5 of Scott Henderson, Jalen Green, RJ Barrett, Jabari Smith Jr, and Alperen Sengun with KPJ, Josh Christopher, Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, and Usman Garuba off the bench sounds incredibly lethal a few years down the road. Don’t be surprised if this team rises from the ashes a lot sooner than expected.</p>
