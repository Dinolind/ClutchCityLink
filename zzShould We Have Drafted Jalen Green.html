        <h1>Did the Rockets Make the Right Choice Drafting Jalen Green in 2021?</h1>
        <p>All of the rookies from the 2021 NBA draft are now sophomores, and have had a season to showcase everything they can do on an NBA court. Of course, none of them have reached anywhere close to their full potential, but I thought it would be interesting to take a look back on the decision to select Jalen Green at #2 overall. It was back and forth between him and Evan Mobely right up until draft night, and those 2, along with Scottie Barnes, have been in direct competition since making it to the league. All 3 have had great starts to their NBA careers, which we were all expecting given how loaded that draft class was. Including Cade Cunningham, the top 4 selections were easily worthy of being number 1.</p>
        <p>As you should know, the Pistons took Cunningham at #1, the Rockets took Green at #2, the Cavaliers took Mobely at #3, and the Raptors took Scottie Barnes at #4. This means the Rockets could’ve selected any of them outside of Cade Cunningham. Looking back a year later, did they make the right decision? This question will be attempted to answer with the following information. As much as we love Jalen Green in Houston, we have to look back and evaluate the success of the people in charge of drafting the right players. Also, we are able to predict what might have happened if we chose an alternative option.</p>
        <h2>Evan Mobely</h2>
        <p>I’ll start with Mobely because he was the most realistic option for the Rockets to select outside of Jalen Green. Mobely has been exceptional for the Cavaliers posting averages of 14.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.7 blocks, and 0.8 steals so far in his young career. His efficiency on field goal attempts has also been outstanding, but we have to consider the fact that a lot of his shots are easy buckets at the rim. He has also had a lot more team success in Cleveland than Green has had in Houston. The Cavs are currently the 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with a record of 8-1, while the Rockets are now 2-9 after winning against the Magic.</p>
        <p>If the Rockets did select Evan Mobely, their team would look a lot different. I'm going to go ahead and assume that the team would have won a similar number of games last season, and that either Josh Christopher or Eric Gordon would’ve started at the 2. That would’ve resulted in a lineup last season of KPJ, Gordon, Tate, Mobely, and Wood. Maybe even John Wall would’ve actually played with another guard spot being open. I also think Houston ends up with Jaden Ivey in the 2022 draft, which would be a starting lineup of KPJ, Ivey, Gordon, Mobely, and Sengun. That doesn’t look too bad on paper to me. Ivey fits into the current Jalen Green role and Mobely plays alongside Sengun instead of Jabari Smith Jr. I actually don’t know which lineup I would prefer: that one or the one we have now. They seem pretty even to me.</p>
        <h2>Scottie Barnes</h2>
        <p>Scottie Barnes was the other next in line after Evan Mobely and has been equally if not more impressive than him and Jalen Green. Barnes has averaged 15.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 0.7 blocks, and 1.1 steals a game for his career on decent efficiency. For reference, Jalen Green's current career per game numbers are 17.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 0.3 blocks, and 0.7 steals. Like Mobely, though, Barnes has had a lot more team success, so Green’s numbers may be a bit inflated considering that he is the number 1 guy on the roster while Barnes is not. The Raptors are currently 6-5 , and they will face off against the Rockets on November 9th. This could be an important matchup to see who outperforms the other.</p>
        <p>In a fantasy world where the Rockets take Scottie Barnes at #2 overall, their roster would be very different. Barnes is a big, lengthy wing that can play a lot of different positions. My best guess is that in 2021 the starting lineup would’ve been John Wall, KPJ, Gordon, Barnes, and Christian Wood. I’m not sure that I like the fit of that very much, but could see the argument for it. I do still think the Rockets take Jabari Smith Jr. in the 2022 NBA draft, leaving them a hole to fill in the backcourt. If the organization gets Scoot Henderson in this year’s draft, a lineup of KPJ, Henderson, Barnes, Smith, and Sengun sounds absolutely lethal. I would’ve been a long shot, but that definitely would have been a possibility knowing what we know now. Everything changes based on one single decision, so it’s hard to make predictions when you go back and change one thing, as it creates a domino effect. In an ideal world, though, that imaginary lineup looks very appealing as a fan.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Jalen Green is our guy in Houston. There’s no going back on the decision to draft him, and I’m not saying that I would if I could. He’s just the type of guy who can lead a franchise to success, whereas I think the other 2 need somebody ahead of them in the pecking order. I haven’t seen any reason to doubt Green yet, so I’m not too upset when guys drafted below him perform well. Today’s game against the Raptors will be fun to watch as we get two top rookies from last season go head to head. The All-Rookie first team included all of the top 4 picks, so by no means have any of them disappointed. It’s just amazing to see how Houston has ended up with an amazing talent in Jalen Green, and there are still guys picked below him that we have to ask ourselves if we would rather have them. I think the 2021 draft class is going to be one of the better ones, and so far, I’m still happy with the front office’s decision to select the guard from the g-league ignite when they did.
