        <h1>Potential Options That Are Better Than James Harden Returning to Houston This Summer</h1>
        <p>The possibility of James Harden returning to Houston is continuing to grow, with reports from even Adrian Wojnarowski confirming the rumors. I am completely against that idea for a multitude of reasons, which you can read about <a href="zzWhy James Harden Shouldn't Return.html">here</a>. There are plenty of better options than Harden available, which I will be discussing below. Houston needs a replacement point guard. At least, that’s becoming the consensus as we continue to see KPJ play. That’s the role Harden would occupy, so I tried to keep that in mind with these picks. It needs to be somebody that has experience, can facilitate effectively, and isn’t detrimental to the team’s chances at winning a championship.</p>
        <h2>Russell Westbrook</h2>
        <p>Yes, Westbrook’s current contract is enormous, and certainly an overpay at this point in his career. However, that contract ends this off-season, the same off-season where the Rockets are projected to have plenty of cap space. Westbrook is a veteran point-guard who has begun to recognize his deficiencies and adjusted his role to mirror his skillset. Who better as a playmaker than the person with the most triple-doubles in NBA history. I know he can’t shoot, but he won’t really need to, with all of the shooters around him. Westbrook is a true vet who would take a lot less money than Harden this summer, and can provide the same qualities that we are looking for. Westbrook is basically Harden in a few years time minus the shooting, so why waste money overpaying for something we don’t need.</p>
        <h2>Lamelo Ball</h2>
        <p>Lamelo Ball doesn’t have the experience you maybe would want, but does fit the timeline for Houston a lot more. The Charlotte Hornets have been struggling recently, and their star may ask out sooner than expected. That could be the perfect opportunity for the Rockets to swoop in and offer a trade package that they can’t refuse. It would start with a lot of draft capital. Maybe a few of the Nets’ picks, plus a few of our own, and throw in a young player or two. I think that would be enough. Just imagine a lineup of Ball, Green, a wing from the 2023 draft, Jabari Smith Jr., and Alperen Sengun. Plus, we would have Kevin Porter Jr. as a 6th man, which is something fans have begun to consider. Lamelo is one of the best passers in the game, and would fix many of the same things that Harden would without the downsides.</p>
        <h2>Mike Conley</h2>
        <p>Mike Conley is the perfect veteran guard that could have a similar effect with the Houston Rockets that Chris Paul did with the Phoenix Suns. Conley does have a decently sized contract, but it’s not outrageously expensive and it helps lower his trade value. I think the Jazz would be happy with either a young player or a 1st round pick for him along with salary filler, so he’s definitely a cheaper option than Ball. That being said, the role that he would occupy would be a lot smaller and more specific. If we just want a playmaker and a veteran presence, Mike Conley is a lot better option than Harden is. Plus, the fact that he shot over 40% from 3 for the past 2 seasons helps his case even more. To be honest, the starting lineup could benefit from another shooter and playmaker to keep some games within reach. One downside is that he’s already 35 years old, though, that’s not too bad when you consider that Chris Paul, who has a similar skill set and role, is 37. Even then, Paul is considered to be better than Conley by most people.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: James Harden needs to stay away from Houston this summer. There are better, cheaper options that can do most of what he would bring to the table. If KPJ continues playing like he has been recently, then we won’t even need a new facilitator at all. I do agree the 6th man role suits his playstyle a lot more, but that doesn’t mean the answer has to be the all-star guard from Arizona St. I know we got used to winning, but that team had a ceiling, which was not a championship. Jalen Green needs to be the new face of the franchise and if we pair him up with one of the guys on this list, that backcourt duo would be special to watch. There is also the possibility of getting someone on the draft with our, presumably, high lottery pick. We don’t need to sign an aging star; that would narrow our championship window and probably not work whatsoever. All of the pieces are there for the young core in Houston to last for many years; let’s not ruin it.</p>
