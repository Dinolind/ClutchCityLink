        <h1>What Happened to Josh Christopher + the Rockets' Minutes Crisis</h1>
        <p>This season Josh Christopher has only played less than 8 minutes per game, and in a limited number of games at that. It’s surprising to see someone who impressed everyone during his rookie season seemingly fall out of the rotation almost instantly. What exactly happened? It’s not like Christopher has been injured or chosen to take games off, and he is supposed to be a part of what the organization is trying to build in the future. It’s odd to see his production fall off a cliff instead of improving during his sophomore season, and it’s even more shocking that the minutes he fought hard to earn have vanished.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The guard from Arizona State was selected by the Houston Rockets with the #23 pick in the 2021 NBA draft. After initially being sent down to the G-league Vipers for developmental purposes, it quickly became clear that he deserved a spot in the regular rotation, and was called up shortly after as a result. In 74 games last season, Christopher averaged 7.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.2 blocks, 0.9 steals in about 18 minutes per game. He came off the bench alongside D.J. Augustin and eventually Dennis Schroder, and appeared to be outperforming some of the guys selected above him.</p>
        <p>This year has been a completely different story. He hasn’t gotten practically any real minutes, outside of garbage time near the end of blowouts, and it may continue like that for a while. The guard’s efficiency also has taken a hit from 45 FG% to 40 FG% and 30 3P% to 21 3P%. However, that’s to be expected when he doesn’t have time to heat up on offense before being subbed out. There’s also not a very big sample size to prove the validity of his lower shooting numbers.  For one reason or another, a promising young prospect has turned into a bench warmer in the matter of one off-season.</p>
        <h2>What Went Wrong?</h2>
        <p>The simple answer is that there are too many players that deserve minutes on this team. Of course Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., and Eric Gordon are all going to get considerable amounts of the guard minutes, meaning only about 1 or 2 of the following players will actually get playing time: Josh Christopher, Daishen Nix, Garrison Mattews, Tyty Washington Jr. So far this season, the backup guard spots have been given to Nix and Matthews over Christopher. Washington has been sent down to the G-league and Christopher may be next. It’s unfortunate, but that’s what happens in the NBA.</p>
        <p>The simple answer, in theory, would be to trade Eric Gordon. In reality, though, that doesn’t really work. The team needs a veteran to guide them, and Gordon is also basically on the last year of his contract. The organization doesn’t want to take on any long-term salary in return, to preserve their cap-space for free agency, so that limits their options significantly. Nobody is going to give up a young player and/or a future first plus expiring money for a year and a half of Eric Gordon. He’s just not worth that anymore, especially at the age of 33, nearly 34.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Hopefully Josh Christopher can work his way back into a significant role, or maybe a miracle will happen and the perfect trade for Eric Gordon will become available. We saw how productive he was last season and know his work ethnic, so he should be given more opportunity. I’m sorry, but he should be more important than Garrison Matthews. I think it’s interesting to see how Usman Garuba was getting practically no minutes last year while Christopher was getting some and now it’s flipped. I’m glad we’ve had an opportunity to see what both of them can do, and I still want to see them given a more consistent role in the lineup.</p>
        <p>The problem with having so many young players is the lack of playing time to go around. What’s going to happen when inevitably the whole roster is healthy? Does that mean players like Tari Eason or Garuba are out of the rotation entirely? I definitely don’t want to see that happen, but it does feel like a real possibility. Some tough decisions are going to have to be made sooner rather than later. That’s why this season is so important as far as figuring out who are the best players to keep her for several years. It’s a very interesting situation where so many minutes are up for grabs, yet, at the same time, there’s nowhere close to enough minutes to go around.</p>
