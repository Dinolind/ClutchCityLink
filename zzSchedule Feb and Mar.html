        <h1>What to look for in the last two months of the Rockets Schedule (Feb. & Mar.)</h1>
        <p>As the season winds down, many of the goals set at the beginning of the year start to shift based on how the team has performed up to that point. The teams at the top of the conference start figuring out the best way to have the easiest road to the NBA finals, the ones in the middle of the pack treat the last month of the regular season like the playoffs, and the bottom tier intentionally start to lose games in preparation for the upcoming draft lottery. The Rockets will most likely fall into the third category this upcoming season, but it’s not as clear cut as it may seem. The race to the bottom is going to be more competitive next season compared to the past 2 years, with several teams ridding themselves of talent in hopes of landing top prospect, Victor Wembenyama.</p>
        <p>For the Rockets this has taken the form of dealing Christian Wood this off-season, looking for a trade partner to finally ship off Eric Gordon, and buying out John Wall. As much as I hate to admit it, if the Rockets are not fighting for a Play-In spot come February, it may be better for them in the long run to lose on purpose for the remainder of the season. Any potential All-Stars will already have been selected by this point, and this is the last year where the Rockets still own their own first round pick. On the brighter side, February and March, plus like 5 games in April, will hopefully be where everything comes together. I think by this point, the roster will look more like a team than just a group of talented basketball players.</p>

        <h2>February 2023</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups: 2/3 vs Toronto, 2/15 @OCK</h4>
        <p>The most eventful thing that happens in February is the all-star break. Apart from that it’s just same ol’ same ol’ from a majority of teams around the league. The playoff picture starts to become more defined and the award races begin to heat up. By this point most NBA fans are looking forward to the playoffs, but as a fan of an organization that is projected to be in the lottery, here are some other things to be excited about in February. The trade deadline will serve as a way for the Rockets to finally get rid of Eric Gordon and other players that could be better utilized somewhere else. Jalen Green may assert himself among the top 10 shooting guards around the league by this point, and Jabari Smith Jr. may emerge as the top Rookie of the Year candidate.</p>
        <p>Against Toronto on the 3rd, two of the top rookies from the 2021 NBA Draft, Jalen Green and Scottie Barnes, will battle head to head and determine who is better by close to the end of year number 2. Another thing to watch out for in this game is seeing how well the Rockets’ new guys can match up against a lanky team like Toronto. When the team faces OCK on the 15th, it will be for the 3rd time in two weeks. This series of games could potentially help determine who wins Rookie of the Year between Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith Jr. Another game I wanted to mention is 1/28 @ Detroit. While technically not in February, it will still be a key matchup for multiple reasons. The number 3 and 4 picks from this year’s draft will have the opportunity to match up with one another. Additionally, the pistons are expected to be another team towards the bottom of the league again next season, and this game could be critical in deciding who will receive the highest lottery odds come June.</p>
        <h2>March 2023</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups: 3/5 vs San Antonio, 3/7 vs Brooklyn, 3/31 vs Detroit</h4>
        <p>The final month of the season, outside of a few games in April, acts like the conclusion of a story. The main characters from the year either come to a sustainable position or end with a cliffhanger. We saw that last season with Jalen Green ending 2022 with a stretch of 5 games with 30 or more points plus a 41-point career high on April 10th. This period showed flashes of greatness and it was a shame that he was beginning to hit his stride just as the season was ending. If any vets remain on the team, they will likely be shut down by this point and the Rookies/Sophomores will get a chance to learn how to play with each other in new lineups.</p>
        <p>The battle between two of the Texas teams on the 5th of March is the 2nd day in a row where they face off. The Spurs are going to start their rebuild next season, after trading away Dejonte Murray, and both organizations may be trying to lose these games as a result, which should make for some interesting bloopers. By March of next year we will know more about what the future holds for the Brooklyn Nets. If the team completely falls apart, the Rockets may want to let Brooklyn win this game if they have a higher chance of getting the #1 overall selection in the draft. This is because Houston has the right to swap its pick with Brooklyn, if they so desire, because of the James Harden trade. Finally, Jaden Ivey and Jabari Smith Jr. will play each other in one of the final games of the season, and may impact the Rookie of the Year race. Additionally, it will be a chance for the Pistons to see why they should’ve taken Jalen Green #1 overall just a season ago.</p>
        <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
        <p>Before you know it, the 2023 off-season will be upon us and the Rockets will be trying to gear up to compete, so enjoy the worry-free days while they last. As you probably recognize, it feels like the 2017 season wasn’t that far ago, and now it’s been almost 5 years. Although the Rockets got dealt a relatively tough schedule, I believe it is full of exciting games and opportunities for development. It’s time to see what Stephan Silas can do with a roster full of guys that have enormous upside, and I can’t wait to see it all unfold. They may not win a lot of games, but the Rockets will hopefully be a more enjoyable team to watch than last season. By the 2023 summer, the first step should’ve been taken on the upslope that leads to an NBA championship.</p>
