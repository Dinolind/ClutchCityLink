        <h1>Exploring the Possibility of the Houston Rockets Keeping and Extending Eric Gordon?</h1>
        <p>Eric Gordon has expressed wanting clarity on his future with the organization. Not necessarily asking out, but questioning what lies ahead for him and the Houston Rockets. He’s the veteran of the squad, and knows that his place one the roster is in jeopardy. The timeline of everybody else just doesn’t align with his. Additionally, Gordon is essentially on the last year of his contract, with next season only being partially guaranteed. Trading him has seemed like the obvious move to make for months now, yet it still hasn’t happened. I’m convinced there has to be a reason why outside of an underwhelming return package. Should the front office really consider keeping him here long term? Both cases are outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Keeping Gordon</h2>
        <p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Eric Gordon provides a veteran presence that this team desperately needs. Without him, everything would be more reckless than it already is. We wouldn’t have anybody to help close out games, or keep other guys in check. The recent Chicago Bulls are a perfect example of what can happen when you go all in on the youth movement. While they had a lot of young talent, those pieces never reached their full potential, possibly due to having no quality, older players on the roster. Now their team is stuck in the land of NBA mediocrity, which is exactly where the Rockets don’t want to end up. Gordon wouldn’t allow that to happen. He comes into work everyday and sets an example for other guys to follow. We may not see the impact of this right now, but definitely will if/when he is gone.</p>
        <p>He also means so much to the team and the city in general. If Gordon wants to finish out his career here in Houston, then let him. We almost owe it to him, given how much effort he puts in night in and night out. Houston’s Basketball culture just wouldn’t be the same without him. Yes, we may be able to get another late first, meaning another asset or young player. However, is that something we really need? Could it be better to hold onto a quality role player that can help us win games when the time comes. It’s almost impossible to take a team that has never experienced success, and turn it into a championship contender in the matter of a couple years. There has to be guys that know how to perform in the playoffs and in close games during the regular season. Gordon is one of those guys. Yes, we could replace him, but why go through all the hassle for somebody who is likely going to be worse.</p>
        <h2>Trading Gordon</h2>
        <p>If we trade Eric Gordon before his contract expires, we will at least get something back in return. Waiting until the end of the season means that he could just walk for nothing. Why not maximize his value right now? Furthermore, some other team could definitely utilize his abilities much more than the Rockets can at this point in time, and be willing to give up assets to acquire him. Pretty much every team needs a wing that can shoot, play defense, and create a little bit of offense while not demanding the ball on every possession. I just don’t want to see his career wasted on a bad team when he needs to go and compete for a championship. </p>
        <p>It has been clear for a while now that Gordon is the odd man out of the current youth movement in Houston. Everybody is gone from the “James Harden Era” except for him. It appears obvious that the time has come for him to move on. Talented veterans just aren’t supposed to waste the last few of their prime years playing for lottery teams. The average age on the Rockets’ roster is about 23 years old; Gordon is almost 34. That’s a 10 year difference. By the time the Rockets are good again, he could be 37 or older. Does he really want to wait that long to compete? Unless he can pull off a miracle, like Lebron James has, at that age retirement is a real option. I’m not even sure that he would be able to contribute very much in a few years, and with the money the organization would have to pay him, I’m not sure that it would be worth it.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>For now, I’m fine with keeping Eric Gordon on the roster and maybe even extending him. I wouldn’t give him a 4 year deal, but maybe something in the ball park of 2 years/$30 million. At that price, I feel comfortable given what he provides to the organization as a whole. If we let him walk or find a trade, I also hope the Rockets replace him with somebody. We’ve seen what can happen when you don’t have a balance of youth and experience, and I certainly don’t want the Rockets to wander down that path. In theory, it would be nice to have everyone be exactly the same age, but in reality that just doesn’t work. Either a trade or an extension is going to happen. I don’t see him leaving for nothing. Either way, I’ll be happy as long as there is at least one older veteran in the top 6 of the rotation.
