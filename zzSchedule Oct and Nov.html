        <h1>An In-Depth Look at the Rockets 2022-2023 NBA Schedule (Oct. & Nov.)</h1>
        <p>As you may know, the Rockets’ 2022-2023 NBA schedule was recently released. Full of surprises and important matchups, it is definitely worth taking a deeper look. The schedule is a big part of what dictates the course of the season, as everything can change from night to night. This is the first article in a series that will break down everything there is to know about the upcoming games, chronologically, in two month increments. This will include analyzing key matchups, asking the questions that should be answered by watching the Rockets play, and figuring out the significance of each period.</p>
        <p>Even though the team is still firmly in a rebuilding phase, not everything is about wins and losses. Growth will hopefully be the most important concept and a majority of the following examinations will be based on this idea. Hopefully, players will strive to improve their craft, coaches will learn how to effectively impact the athletes, and the front office will look for ways to improve long term success. All of these constitute the term growth. The Rockets have one of the tougher schedules, according to many sources, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The more the young guys face top NBA competition, the more accustomed they will be come playoff time in a few years.</p>
        <p>For a full list of the upcoming Houston Rockets’ scheduled games, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/hou">click here</a>.</p>
        <h2>October 2022</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups: 10/21 vs Memphis, 10/30 @Phoenix</h4>
        <p>The first month will set the tone for the remainder of the season. Many looming questions will finally be answered, such as, “TyTy Washington vs Daishen Nix?” and “Who will be the 5th starter?” It will also be the first look at the Rockets picks from the 2021 NBA draft since last season. There is likely to be a big jump in performance for these guys, after a full NBA offseason, and this will be their opportunity to make those expectations a reality. Just from what we have seen in workout clips and overseas basketball, I don’t predict any of them to disappoint. The first week and a half will be extremely tough; however, it will hopefully prepare the Rockets for the grueling year ahead.</p>
        <p>As it stands today, Jalen Green will face off against a former or reigning all-star guard in every game scheduled for the month. Probably the most exciting of these matchups is Houston’s home opener against the Grizzlies. Ja Morant vs Jalen Green will likely be a classic that includes many highlight reel moments and displays of unreal athletic ability from both teams. A day later, the Rockets will battle the 2021 NBA Champion, Milwaukee Bucks, and get their first taste of a win-now team. October 30th will serve as Chris Paul’s chance to compete against his former team, and based off what we saw on February 16th last season, this one should be a good one.</p>
        <h2>November 2022</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups: 11/7 @Orlando, 11/16 @Dallas, 11/26 vs OKC</h4>
        <p>The first full month of the season is packed with games worth watching. This will be the first opportunity to look at the incoming rookies after giving them a chance to adjust to the NBA level. The prospects’ respective roles will hopefully be defined by November, and we as fans will get a chance to examine each of their abilities. November projects to be an easier month for the team, so hopefully they will gain momentum. The first week and a half of the month, over 6 games, sees them play only one top-6 seed from last season, which could be an opportunity for an early win-streak. This month also includes two of the four Rockets’ nationally televised games on November 12th and 26th, both on NBA TV.</p>
        <p>When the Rockets battle Orlando, it will be a way for Jabari Smith to show them why he should’ve been taken number 1 in the draft. Paolo Banchero is now the NBA’s golden boy and Smith will attempt to bring the spotlight back on him. When they play Dallas, Christian Wood will get revenge against his former team and the Rockets will get a look at a conference-finals lineup from last season. Luka vs Jalen Green is going to be a matchup for the ages. Not to mention the possibility of having a hilarious Boban Marjonovic tribute video. Against OKC on the 26th, Jabari Smith will have another chance to face off against a fellow top 3 pick in Chet Holmgren. Alperen Sengun will continue to prove why the Thunder shouldn’t have traded him last season, and I think the Rockets stand a good chance of winning this game.</p>
        <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
        <p>October and November will hopefully be a great way to kick off the 2022-2023 season. We are now less than two months away from the end of the NBA offseason, and I couldn’t be more eager for the first game. Seeing all of the young players, with less than 4 years of experience, grow and develop together is something the Rockets haven’t had in a while. Ever since James Harden left, the future has looked pretty bleak, but I believe this season will turn things around. We just saw what is possible when a team acquires two top-3 picks in back-to-back years, with the Boston Celtics. This season will give a clear indication of whether or not the Rockets are on that path.
