        <h1>How Is Jae'Sean Tate Going To Integrate Back Into the Rocket's Rotation?</h1>
        <p>Per Stephen Silas, Jae’Sean Tate is “now days away instead of weeks” from returning to the court. Should that be the case, obviously some changes are going to be made to the Rockets’ rotation. Of course, unless Tate is going to remain on the bench, which I don’t foresee happening. We all knew this day would come, and now it’s time to try and sort out an already overcrowded lineup. Last year he played almost 27 minutes per game, and those have to come from somewhere, even though I think it will be less this season. Below are some possibilities for what I could see happening upon his return.</p>
        <h2>Mathews and Fernando Out</h2>
        <p>This first scenario is the one I’m most in favor of. Mathews and Fernando are not a part of the long-term future here and their minutes should go to Jae’Sean Tate. Besides, we need another wing, whereas we don’t need a 3rd center getting playing time or a 7th guard either. These two are the odd ones out in my eyes. Right now, Mathews and Fernando are averaging 13 and 11 minutes per game, respectively, in the ones they play in. If we take these and give them to Tate, he’s looking at right around 20 minutes per night out on the court, which is exactly the number I think he should be given with the evidence we have right now. Unfortunately, I don’t think this will actually happen. Stephen Silas has shown that he’s just not the type of guy to bench players outright in favor of others.</p>
        <h2>Spread Minutes Out Evenly</h2>
        <p>Right now the Rockets run a 13-man rotation on some nights, so what’s one more? If you just take away 2 minutes from each guy and give them all to Tate, the numbers start to add up fast. The problem is, I don’t really like this idea. For guys like Josh Christopher, taking 2 minutes off of his average takes him down to only 5 minutes per game. At that point, why even bother playing him. Nobody can get any rhythm going that quickly to even make any sort of impact on a consistent basis. This also means less opportunity for the starters and bench units. It just would affect everybody a little bit rather than a couple a guys a lot, which doesn’t seem like a good idea. Sadly, I do think this option is more realistic than the previous one. Whoever’s in charge might just think, “let’s just keep everybody happy” and opt for a decision similar to this one.</p>
        <h2>Trading Eric Gordon</h2>
        <p>The seemingly most obvious answer is to deal Eric Gordon to free up some playing time for Tate. However, there are a couple of issues with this. First, Gordon isn’t likely to be moved until we get closer to the February 9th trade deadline. That means there will be at least some overlap of both of the guys being healthy. Another problem is that whomever we get in return is likely to command at least some of Gordon’s former minutes. Not to mention the fact that Tate probably isn’t the best fit in the starting lineup in Gordon’s place, unless his shooting has actually improved drastically. The bottom line is that the former 6th man of the year needs to find another team, and I will be very disappointed if he’s still on the roster past the deadline. I don't know if it’s as simple as giving all those minutes to Tate, but his absence would definitely help.</p>
        <h2>Young Guys Get Cut</h2>
        <p>This last theory is the one I would least want to happen, though, I have to recognize it as a real possibility. The fact that Eric Gordon is averaging close to 30 minutes per game tells me that the coaching staff wants to prioritize winning over development. If that’s true, minutes from some combination of Tari Eason, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, and Daishen Nix could end up going to Jae’Sean Tate. This idea is ridiculous and should not happen because the progress of those people listed above is going to play a big part when the team tries to be competitive again. Tate is who he is, unless he becomes a sharpshooter from deep, and I like my odds betting on younger players advancing more than he will. Even though Tate is only in his 3rd season, he’s already 27 years old. I’m sorry, but that’s basically a player’s prime. It is more important to prioritize guys that still have plenty of time before they reach that age.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Jae’Sean Tate’s return is going to be interesting to watch. The only thing I’m truly hoping for is that he can stay healthy past this point. Lingering ankle injuries can be devastating to a player’s career, so I hope it has been properly addressed during his time off. As for the rotation, my prediction is that some combination of spreading out minutes and trading away Eric Gordon will occur. The minutes crisis is only going to get worse for a period of time, and then hopefully some of it can be solved with an Eric Gordon trade in less than 2 months. Cuts in the lineup are going to have to be made eventually, and we may see some come pretty soon. There’s a reason most championship teams don’t run more than a 10-man rotation: it just doesn’t work. Part of me is even beginning to question if Tate should even be a part of that group of 10 by next season.</p>
