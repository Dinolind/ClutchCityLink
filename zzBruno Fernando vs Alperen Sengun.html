        <h1>Should Bruno Fernando Be the New Starting Center Over Alperen Sengun?</h1>
        <p>2 games of the regular season are now in the books, and so far we’ve seen Bruno Fernando start in both games over Alperen Sengun. Does this mean Sengun’s time as a starter was limited to just a few preseason games? This question has come out of nowhere, but is an important thing to ask. The fact that Sengun was supposed to be the starter for months leading up to the season, and now has seemingly lost his spot shouldn’t be overlooked. The Rockets could just be testing out something new, or this could be worth taking a deep dive into. Below is everything we know so far as well as my predictions for the future.</p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun’s Struggles </h2>
        <p>Throughout all of preseason, Sengun just didn’t look like the same player we saw last year or overseas this summer. In 3 games, he averaged just 9 points and about 4 rebounds with an equal assist-to-turnover ratio, in around 21 minutes per contest. Not very impressive given the expectations. Plus, when he was on the court, the offense looked stagnant and the defense sort of fell apart. It became evident that he, Jalen Green, and Kevin Porter Jr. had a tough time coexisting on the floor. Not what you want to see as a fan. Although he did play well with Jabari Smith Jr. , the starting lineup just simply didn’t work as a whole.</p>
        <h2>Bruno Fernando’s Success</h2>
        <p>Fernando wasn’t given as much of an opportunity to display his skillset in the initial 4 games, but definitely made the most of it. Based on numbers alone, Sengun looks to have had the better preseason. However, Fernando didn’t receive nearly as many minutes, so naturally his numbers were going to be less. He did, though, appear to fit into the defense and offense of the team more smoothly. Fernando also symbolizes the culture of playing hard and being a super athletic team, like the Rockets want to be, a lot more than Sengun does. He is also a better fit alongside Green and KPJ. The organization knew how talented he was when they offered him a 4 year contract, and now he's been able to show the fans.</p>
        <h2>So, Who Should Start?</h2>
        <p>After being terrible in preseason, Sengun has bounced back at least a little bit. He’s been solid through the first 2 games, except for late in the 4th quarter against the Grizzlies, ultimately costing the Rockets the win. Fernando, on the other hand, has started and still played relatively well. It’s a nice surprise to see someone who was on the cusp of making the roster have a real impact. The team is lucky to have him. That being said, his spot is not guaranteed. It’s only a matter of time before even tougher competition than Alperen Sengun emerges for Bruno Fernando. He has been impressive so far, but doesn’t have the consistency to back it up just yet.</p>
        <p>For now, I would still like Sengun to be the starter on most nights. In my opinion, the team needs him to develop, and the only way to do that is by giving him plenty of minutes. I just think the Rocket’s potential is much higher with Sengun on the court over Fernando. It’s just going to take some reps to see it all come together. The decision may have just gotten easier for the coaching staff when Fernando went down with an injury in the middle of Friday’s game. No one knows much yet, but he could be out for a week or more depending on how bad it is.</p>
        <p>I’m still very optimistic about Alperen Sengun’s future. He has such unique talents that you just can’t teach, which is very valuable in the NBA. It’s just a shame he hasn’t played well as a starter just yet. Being only 20 years old, we should have seen this coming. Young players just don’t have the experience or consistency of veterans. Another issue with all of this is: what happens with Usman Garuba? Garuba hasn’t gotten much of a chance to prove himself in the NBA after being a first round pick just a season ago, and having Fernando on the roster ruins his chances even more. Even Jabari Smith Jr. was playing backup center over him. We’ll see what happens, but don’t be surprised when Garuba’s tenure with the Rockets is cut short.</p>
