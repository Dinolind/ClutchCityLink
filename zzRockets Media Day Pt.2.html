        <h1>Houston Rockets 2022 Media Day Analysis, Summary, and Reactions Part 2</h1>
        <p>With training camp well underway, Rockets 2022 Media Day has come and gone. There is a lot to dissect with everything we heard, and this article will attempt to be a way to accomplish that. Since this is part 2, I already covered the interviews from Stephen Silas, Rafael Stone, Eric Gordon, Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, Jalen Green, and Boban Marjanovic, which you can find <a href="zzRockets Media Day Pt.1.html">here</a>. So, that leaves us with Garrison Matthews, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr., Josh Christopher, Kevin Porter Jr., and Alperen Sengun to take a look at. There’s so much cover with this group, just like the other one, so I won’t waste any more of your time and get straight into it.</p>
        <p>Here are the links to the full media day livestream:

        <h2>Garrison Matthews</h2>
        <p>Garrison Matthews has bounced around the league a lot, and is very thankful to have found a presumably long-term home with the Houston Rockets. However, the Rockets guard recognizes there is still a lot for him to prove and needs to play his best in order to do so. He loves all of the young talent and wants to get better while building chemistry with the other players, this upcoming season. John Lucas keeps getting mentioned as someone who knows what he’s talking about and is well respected by the players, which is no different here. Matthews is also going to strive to improve his defense, which seems to be a common theme, and knows he has to be more consistent to solidify a spot in the rotation. He seems confident, but still hungry for more throughout his interview. Mattews needs to have an impressive campaign, to show us why he still belongs on this team, and from what we heard it definitely seems possible.</p>
        <h2>Jabari Smith Jr.</h2>
        <p>The Rockets’ number 3 overall pick certainly has a lot to prove after a somewhat underwhelming Summer League, but I’m not even close to doubting him yet. During his availability, Smith talks mainly about his strengths on defense, versatility, and how he is going to refine his game. He has spent a lot of time just experiencing his new city, Houston, and working on adjusting to the NBA 3-point line. He talks about how his reps with Sengun have been very effective so far, which should be a good sign for fans. A lot about Smith’s game is yet to be revealed at this level, so we’ll just have to wait and see what kind of player he becomes. He might still be growing taller, which is just scary to think about, and also has added a lot of muscle over the off-season. I think it may take 20 games or so for him to find his footing, but once he does it’ll sure be fun to watch.</p>
        <h2>Kenyon Martin Jr.</h2>
        <p>You’ve probably heard the story by now that Kenyon Martin Jr. still seems like he wants to be traded, based on what we heard and saw from him on September 26th. He started off by talking about how much he’s worked out, pretty much everybody has said that, and that he wants to win more games. However, KJ continues to reiterate throughout his interview that, “I’m here to do my job” in a very non-enthusiastic tone, possibly suggesting he is still unhappy about being in Houston. He says all the things I guess he was told to say about both the team and himself constantly looking for growth, but he really didn’t answer all that many questions. If you want to look at some Kenyon Martin Jr. trades, you can read my article linked <a href="zzKenyon Martin Jr Trade 2022.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Josh Christopher</h2>
        <p>Josh Christopher might be my favorite player based on what we saw last season, and he did not disappoint at media day. He said he spent a lot of time in the gym, like most others, working on his shooting. He mentioned how John Lucas would have them up at 6am getting reps in. He also believes that the Rockets are going to be the best team in the league one day, and described this team as electric, just like Jae’Sean Tate, which I think is fitting for the current state of the organization. Jaygup also knows the NBA is a grind and wants the new rookies to come in and work. Christopher also talks about the unmatched sense of comradery about this team since lots of guys knew each other before the NBA. I think that kind of chemistry could take them far. Christopher then goes on to mention how much Bill Russell meant to everyone. There is also the topic brought up about his clothing line, and Christopher thinks he is going to be more of a fashion star this year, which will obviously improve his abilities on the court. Time will tell on that one, though.
        </p>
        <h2>Kevin Porter Jr.</h2>
        <p>KPJ easily had the best interview in the eyes of many. Just from the way he spoke about things, you could tell how much he’s matured. He isn’t worried about his contract extension and is just focusing on next season playing alongside Jalen Green. Porter wants to play fast, have good defense, and learn from mistakes. He worked on mostly finishing and shooting over the summer and looks to take a big jump. A little bit of shade was thrown at Nets for not having any defense, which you gotta appreciate, and he has built a lot of trust with his teammates as the point guard of the future. Porter says the Rockets helped him turn his life around, and he is very grateful for that. However, there is still a lot left for him to accomplish. Everybody on this team believes they can be the best in the league sooner rather than later, and I love to hear that. I think Porter is in a much better place to focus on basketball than ever before, and hopefully that translates to the court. This season is going to be different for him, which is why I still think the Rockets need to lock him down now before he becomes too expensive.
        </p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun</h2>
        <p>First off, Alpi’s English has gotten a lot better, which is very impressive considering how hard it is to learn a foreign language. He wants the team to be better next season, but also knows everybody is still very young and has a lot to learn. Sengun also confirmed that he’s going to start, which we pretty much already knew, and wants to work on defense and rebounding to retain that position. He likes his fit alongside Jabari, which comes as no surprise, and learned a lot playing overseas this off-season. This is the first time where he’s at least somewhat adjusted to his new environment in the United States and is happy that he can now fit in. He mentions how he stayed busy playing in EuroBasket over the summer, and feels a lot stronger because of it. Also, Nikola Jokic is now his idol, which can only be a good sign for the future. I’m predicting that Sengun will be more confident both on and off the court, which should hopefully boost his production.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Aside from Kenyon Martin Jr, this team is all very excited for the future in Houston. Everybody has, in theory, put in a ton of work in the gym over the past few months, so that’ll be something to watch for going forward. If the team can really play better defense, I don't see why they can’t take a jump in the standings. Everybody knows this season is still focused on improvement, which is good because they are all on the same page. So, don’t get discouraged when we are not in playoff contention midway through the year, but instead look at it from a long-term perspective. This team is one of the youngest in basketball, so they aren’t expected to be able to compete right away anyways. Overall, I think the Rockets Media Day left a good impression on many fans, and now I am even more pumped for the season to begin. October 19th against the Hawks can’t come soon enough.</p>
