        <h1>Everything You Need to Know About the Rockets Schedule (December and January)</h1>
        <p>The middle of an NBA season is often overlooked, but it is usually where some very important things happen. It can determine whether the year was a success or a failure. Most importantly, player growth is frequently established around this time, as young stars begin to emerge as a top talent. The athletes competing for all-star nominations and award races become more clear cut. We have seen previously that after the first 2 months, momentum has created that can lead to win streaks, but if the team takes their foot off the gas it can be detrimental in the long-term. That’s why December and January can be some of the most important months of the NBA season.</p>
        <p>These two months may show that the Rockets are not ready to compete, seeing how this is a tougher stretch of the season. However, they can also show the direction of the team moving forward. Rotations will become more set in stone, players will carve out their roles, and I believe at least one of the young guys will start to break out. After everything is settled in, don’t be surprised if someone like Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green, or Tari Eason has an unbelievable stretch of games. Whether this happens or not, one thing for sure is that someone has to take the shots. With vets, like Christian Wood and Dennis Schroder, gone from last season, something is going to give.</p>
        <p>For a full list of the upcoming Houston Rockets’ scheduled games, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/hou">click here</a>.</p>
        <h2>December 2022</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups: 12/5 vs Philadelphia, 12/15 vs Miami, 12/21 vs Orlando</h4>
        <p>December is usually the point at which NBA teams start to put everything together. It’s the month where the off-season rust has worn off and the players still have more energy than at the end of the season. It will be a good time to see exactly where the new rookies are with their development. Maybe something happens by this point that adjusts the lineup, but most likely this will be a great opportunity for the team to build chemistry. The holiday season will also allow more people to go to games and see their favorite players perform.</p>
        <p>When Harden comes to town in December, it will certainly be an emotional game. Who knows? Maybe even Eric Gordon is on the other side of the court by December 5th. The Rockets have a lot of former players on the Sixers and even the former GM, Daryl Morey, is now a part of their franchise. When the Rockets play Miami, Victor Oladipo will hopefully get a chance to properly revisit Houston after the game last season was also his first game back from injury. The 21st against Orlando could be a turning point in the Rookie of the Year race between Paolo Banchero and Jabari Smith. Both players should have their footing by then and will fight hard to outplay the other.</p>
        <h2>January 2023</h2>
        <h4>Key Matchups; 1/11 @Sacramento, 1/23 vs Minnesota, 1/26 vs Cleveland</h4>
        <p>Fresh off the new year celebration, January is normally the month that the playoff teams become more solidified. Although the Rockets most likely won’t be in contention, being significantly behind other teams might encourage the organization to experiment with the rotation. While at the beginning of the season the lineup is usually pretty consistent, after the halfway point, Stephen Silas may choose to mix some things up when they have nothing to lose. Another event that happens around this time is all-star voting. If, for example, Jalen Green gets involved in all-star conversations, it may incentive him to play even harder.</p>
        <p>1/11 @Sacramento is the only nationally-televised, Rockets game that is not on NBA TV. This is the one game for all of the young guys to display their abilities with everybody watching, and I expect this will be something that you won’t want to miss. The game against Minnesota on the 23rd is the 3rd time in roughly 2 weeks that the team gets to face the newly assembled front court of Karl Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert. This stretch will be a good way to determine if Sengun is capable of being the starting center of the future, on both ends of the flood. A few days later against the Cavs, Jalen Green will go against an all-star guard from last year in Darius Garland, possibly a few days before the voting closes. Although they are not in the same conference, if Green outplays Garland in this game it will be tough for the voters to justify putting 1 in without the other.</p>
        <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
        <p>If once again the Rockets struggle in December and January, as they did last season by going 6-20 after the conclusion of the win streak that began in November, these games could be tough to watch. However, there are some positives if you know where to look. Letting some of the players we drafted over the past two years get tons of NBA experience is something that is invaluable and will certainly pay off in the future. Jalen Green has the potential to come out at an All-Star level next year, after what we saw at the end of last season, and watching him boost his production and display his talents could be fun to watch. Many fans will start to turn off the games come January, but those who stay committed to the team will know for sure what it took when the Rockets hopefully win a championship in the next 5 or so years.
