        <h1>Should John Lucas Replace Stephen Silas For the Rest of the Season?</h1>
        <p>It feels like at this point any day could be Stephen Silas’ last with the Houston Rockets. The team has been in continual decline since getting off to a promising start at the beginning of the season, and it’s usually the coach who is the first to go. It’s sad but an unfortunate reality of major sports. Silas has taken a considerable portion of the blame for the lack of team success because of his somewhat questionable decisions. His tenure will almost certainly end in the coming few months, so we have to determine what happens next. But first, let’s recap how the organization even ended up here in the first place.</p>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Stephen Silas came in after Mike D'Antoni to coach James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and hopefully lead them to a championship. This never happened as both of those players were shipped away for assets that ultimately jump-started this rebuild. Silas was now forced into a completely different role than the one he signed up for, and it hasn’t worked out very well. This should’ve been expected, though. A “win-now” coach was not supposed to be the man in charge of a rebuild, yet it happened anyway.</p>
        <p>Speaking of his disappointing 3rd season with the Rockets, we first have to look at how he structures the rotations. To keep it blunt, they have been absolutely terrible. I’m honestly done mentioning it, but Silas continues to play vets over prospects in an attempt to win games. Furthermore, he seems to have given up, or maybe the players have just given up on him. There’s no real fight or care, and everybody just goes along with the idea that it’s okay to be the worst team in the league for 3 consecutive seasons. His offense has also left something to be desired. Iso-ball has taken over and there have been so many losses that have stemmed from that decision. Although this could just be an execution problem that suggests the players are at fault, something tells me he has played a part in it as well.</p>
        <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
        <p>After yet another terrible crushing defeat against the Jazz on January 5th, he’s probably on very thin ice within the organization. I’ve always thought that they would keep him until at least the end of this season, when the franchise really needs to make some major changes, but I think now that it will happen sooner than that. He has lost favor with a majority of the fans and hasn’t shown any improvement since the start of the year. Unless a miracle happens and the roster suddenly goes on a 5 or 6-game win streak, my prediction is for him to be gone sometime this month. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the news breaks sometime this week.</p>
        <p>In that event, John Lucas seems like the perfect person to serve in the interim position. Lucas was a finalist when Silas was first hired back in October of 2020 and is well-liked by basically everyone. Lucas seems to care a lot more, too, as he is often seen yelling at players and making sure they understand and learn from their mistakes when they happen. Just go back and listen to Rockets’ media day and it will become apparent that Lucas is a lot closer with a majority of the players already. The team has even had more success in games where Lucas had to take over for one reason or another.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We need somebody who cares, a leader, and a tough but understanding person to lead this young core, and that could be John Lucas. Stephen Silas has shown that he’s not the answer, and I’m sorry, but should be let go immediately. If not now, then at the end of the season for sure. There’s too many issues to be addressed, that it’s just time for someone new to take over. I know this comes at a difficult time in Silas’ life, but it’s just how life works and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. I am sick of watching blowout after blowout, and want something to be changed. It’s time for the higher ups to realize what’s best for the future of Houston basketball.
