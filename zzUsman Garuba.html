        <h1>Detailing Usman Garuba’s Current Situation with the Houston Rockets.</h1>
        <p> So far, the most underwhelming prospect to come from the Rockets' massive 2021 NBA Draft haul has to be Usman Garuba. While his peers have excelled in their respective roles on this rebuilding team, he has dealt with multiple injuries and a lack of opportunity during his rookie season. These issues have sprung up several questions regarding his future status with the team. However, he was a first round pick just a season ago and many fans, including myself, are optimistic for what he can bring to the team this upcoming year.</p>
        <p>About a month ago, Garuba was slated to be a major piece of the Rockets’ summer league roster, alongside Josh Christopher and Jabari Smith Jr, but once again fell victim to injury. He twisted his ankle in a practice before the first game and hoped that he would be able to return, which he never did. The opportunity for the former number 23 overall pick to prove himself had sadly faded away. So, we are left to speculate about how much of an impact Usman Garuba will have on the organization going forward.</p>
        <h2>Usman Garuba So Far</h2>
        <p>Last season, he played a total of 24 games with the Rockets where he averaged 2.0 points, 3.5 rebounds, 0.7 assists, 0.4 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game in 10 minutes a night. Not too impressive considering he was picked ahead of other players like Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Ayo Dosunmu, and Herbert Jones,  who all posted significantly better numbers. However, all 3 of those players are older than Garuba by a wide margin and were all expected to be more “NBA-ready.” In contrast, he was more of a project pick that would need several years to develop.</p>
        <p> He did, however, find more success in the g-league and overseas last season. Garuba was named the ACB Best Young Player during 2021 while playing for Real Madrid in Spain. The power forward also served as a valuable member of the RGV Vipers by averaging 9.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks per game in about 26 minutes and helped the team win the 2022 G-league championship. Garuba’s defense has also been known to be pretty solid, with that being pegged from numerous sources as his greatest strength. This belief has been confirmed by the minutes that we saw from him last season.</p>
        <h2>Usman Garuba Going Forward</h2>
        <p>As it stands today, Garuba is likely to be the backup center behind Alperen Sengun next year, receiving about 10 to 15 minutes per contest. This will finally give him the chance to show fans and the organization what he is capable of at the NBA level. Along with the rebounding skills he provides, Garuba’s defensive ability is something the Rockets desperately needed last season as they finished last in defensive rating for the second year in a row. Furthermore, the team chose not to sign another big-man free agent this offseason, even with several opportunities to do so. This shows that they have full faith in Garuba to take a step and next season, and I doubt he will let them down. Ideally, he would average about 5 points and 5 rebounds to start off the season and gradually work his way into earning more minutes.</p>
        <p>In an alternative world, what happens if this season he once again underperforms. I think he would be sent down to the G–league and have his spot filled by another big man off the bench like Boban Marjonovic, Marquese Chriss, or Bruno Fernando, if not someone out of free agency or via trade. I doubt it, but this might be his last chance to cement himself as part of the future. Nothing he does jumps off the page, and with the high likelihood of the Rockets having multiple firsts in next year’s draft, Garuba's days may be numbered. It’s not easy to see players like him go, but there is a small chance that it could happen sooner than expected.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The past has been a little rocky for Usman Garuba since making it to the NBA, but this season is his opportunity to turn things around. The Rockets draft department has been very successful in identifying talent over the last 2 seasons and I see no reason to doubt them yet. They selected Garuba for his potential to develop over the long-term future and it is clearly too early to give up on him now. This season will reveal more of Garuba’s situation with the team and it may be best to revisit this topic at the end of the year. He undeniably has talent; it's just a matter of using it to surprise some people.
