        <h1>Summarzing and Grading the Rockets’ Off-Season Moves Now That Everything is All Said and Done</h1>
        <p>The first preseason game is almost here, so it’s time to revisit everything that has happened over the past few months, and give my opinions on every transaction. From signing new players to trading some away, many things take place over the off-season. While this year the Rockets didn’t make a big splash, there are still some noteworthy moves that occurred. Below is a list of all of the major ones, in order, along with my grade for each. Note that these are going to be number grades on a 1 to 100 scale instead of traditional letter grades to improve accuracy.</p>
        <h2>Christian Wood Trade:</h2>
        <h4>Grade: 72/100</h4>
        <p>Aside from John Wall exercising his player option, which we all knew was going to happen, this was the first real transaction that occurred. The Rockets sent Christian Wood to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Sterling Brown, Trey Burke, Marquese Chris, Boban Marjonovic, and the draft rights to Wendell Moore Jr. Later, Wendell Moore was traded for TyTy Washington Jr., a 2025 2nd round pick via Minnesota, and a 2027 2nd round pick via Minnesota. Everybody knew Wood was going to be traded in order to open up minutes for Alperen Sengun; it was just a matter of when it would happen. We found out the answer to that question when this trade went down on June 24th.</p>
        <p>My initial reaction to this trade was that we got absolutely fleeced, only getting basically a late first for a fringe all-star type player. However, as I began to dissect it more, the more sense it made. First off, we knew Christian Wood was likely going to leave after his current contract expired, so they got what they could now. Furthermore, all of the players received were on small expiring contracts that help the organization retain their cap space for 2023. Lastly, the pick was flipped during the draft for a decent point guard and two future seconds that have the potential to be pretty low in the draft, when they come around. As for why my grade is not higher, the Rockets failed to get an asset back that could help them in the immediate future and couldn’t get a lottery pick for arguably their best player at the time.</p>
        <h2>NBA Draft:</h2>
        <h4>Grade: 86/100</h4>
        <p>The biggest event for the Rockets this off-season was by far the NBA draft. This was the second year in a row where the team brought in several 1st round talents (4 last year, 3 this year) and now these young guys make up nearly half of the 15 roster spots available. Everybody knew the top three guys for the draft were Jabari Smith Jr., Chet Holmgren, and Paolo Banchero, in that order, so it was a big shock when the Magic took the duke forward number 1 overall. That left the Rockets with Jabari Smith at number 3, which was personally the guy I would’ve taken at number one.</p>
        <p>We also got Tari Eason at pick 17, which appears to be a steal based on what we’ve seen from summer league and workout clips so far. The Rockets also traded for TyTy Washington near the end of the first round, which seems like a good bench guard alongside Josh Christopher going forward. Overall, the draft was a huge win. Anytime you can add multiple quality players that are only going to improve, that tends to be the case. We haven’t seen any of these guys in actual NBA minutes yet, so that’s why my grade is where it’s at. It is just too early to tell how some of them are going to pan out a few years down the road. The future looks bright, but there is still a sense of uncertainty.</p>
        <h2>Resigned Jae’Sean Tate:</h2>
        <h4>Grade: 94/100</h4>
        <p>Resigning Jae’Sean Tate is going to get overlooked, but might’ve been their single best move made. Getting a 2021 all-rookie first team member under a 3 year/$22 million contract is an absolute bargain. Not only is he going to be here long term, but he is also only going to continue to get better. Every championship team needs a person that can facilitate, play defense, and rebound. Just look at the Warriors, who would’ve been a lot worse without Draymond Green. For the Houston Rockets, that is Jae’Sean Tate. Even if he comes off the bench next season, that price is low enough that I’m okay with it. To get Tate locked down now before he has a breakout year is one of the best things the Rockets could’ve done.</p>
        <h2>John Wall Buyout:</h2>
        <h4>Grade: 52/100</h4>
        <p>Honestly, I’m more indifferent to the John Wall buyout than anything else. I guess the organization saved a few bucks, but his contract was going to be over at the end of next season anyways. This was good for Wall, though, because now he’s not stuck on a rebuilding team, and can try to compete for a championship with the Clippers. We did open up a spot on the roster, so that’s one positive, but other than that this seems kind of pointless from the team’s perspective. Maybe it was to uphold their reputation they've built over the past few years of doing right by their players, but Tilam Fertitta could’ve just seen this as a way to cut costs and improve his bottom line.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This off-season was by no means a failure, just a little bit underwhelming. We signed no established free agents, as the Rockets continue to build up their cap space for next season, and also failed to improve the team. If anything, the roster got worse. However, I know this was for a greater cause, and that time will show that it’s all been worth it. I’m so ready for the start of the season so we can really see how these moves impacted the team. I think next year is when we’ll really see some big changes. The team is going to look to make a big jump by the 2023-2024 season, and I am excited to see what happens. As for now, I view the past few months as a success, just maybe not in the way I would’ve originally envisioned.</p>
