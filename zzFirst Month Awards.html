        <h1>First Month of the NBA Season Houston Rockets’ Award Winners (MVP, DPOTY, ROY, etc.)</h1>
        <p>The first NBA game for this season took place on October 18 and it is now November 18. That means we are exactly one month into the season. I thought it would be interesting to assign awards to players exclusively on the Rockets' roster from the first month, like the league does as a whole does at the end of the season. Of course, I won’t be including Coach of the Year or Executive of the Year because for both of those there is only one option. As a result, that leaves us with 5 awards to assign players for: Rookie of the Year, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, and Most Improved Player. Please note that these are not projections in any way, and solely based on what we’ve seen so far this season.</p>
        <h2>Rookie of the Month: Tari Eason</h2>
        <p>For this award there’s really only a few options: Jabari Smith Jr., Eason, Daishen Nix, and Tyty Washington jr. I went with Eason because he’s been the most efficient and best player overall from the options. Currently Eason is averaging, per game, 8.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.5 blocks while shooting an incredible 43% from 3. Probably the runner up, Jabari Smith Jr., has put up numbers of 10.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 0.4 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game. Although the numbers favor Smith, we have to keep in mind that he has been given way more opportunity and minutes than Eason. This is illustrated by the fact that his efficiency is a lot worse than Eason’s. I’m not doubting Smith as a player yet, but have to admit that Eason has been better over the past month.</p>
        <h2>Most Valuable Player: Jalen Green</h2>
        <p>Jalen Green is the face of the franchise and should be, and is, the most valuable player to the organization. He has moments where he takes over games and looks like a true all-star. There’s also not really much competition. Kevin Porter jr. has been good, but very inefficient, and Eric Gordon is no longer a focal point of the team. Green is currently averaging 22 points, 2.7 assists, 3.5 rebounds, 0.3 blocks, and 0.7 steals. Not to mention the fact that he has become a leader night in and night out. So much has been invested in his success, so it’s nice to see him playing well. Green is a future star in the making and can hopefully be our top guy to depend on for many years to come.</p>
        <h2>Defensive Player of the Month: Usman Garuba</h2>
        <p>Garuba is not the flashiest player by any means, but can certainly lock up a lot of opposing players on defense. He can defend both on the perimeter and inside the paint as well as guard multiple positions. It just seems like every time Garuba is on the ball, the guy on offense either turns it over or is forced into a bad shot. We knew the big man from Spain was a defensive monster, and this season he’s finally gotten to prove himself. The energy he provides off the bench is a big reason why the Rockets keep a majority of their games somewhat close, even sometimes coming back to win . Everybody else I considered just wasn’t consistent enough, or didn’t provide as much of an impact as Usman Garuba does in the small amount of minutes he has fought hard to earn.</p>
        <h2>6th Man of the Year: Kenyon Martin jr. </h2>
        <p>For this award, anyone was eligible if they had played a majority of their games while coming off the bench since the Rockets don’t really have a solidified 6th man. I chose Martin because of how impressive he’s been over the first month. The counting stats and the eye test both show how valuable he really is to this roster. After almost falling out of the rotation entirely, Martin has really worked his way into a prominent place within the lineup. The energy he provides is contagious, and some of the best highlights we’ve seen have come from him dunking on or blocking guys way bigger than him. I’m glad the Rockets chose not to trade Martin away because he has proved that he deserves a place on this team and is willing to work hard to earn it.</p>
        <h2>Most Improved Player: Alperen Sengun</h2>
        <p>After a slow start in the preseason and throughout the first few games, Alperen Sengun has really begun to hit his stride. Ever since he’s become the unquestioned starter, with Bruno Fernando being injured, he hasn’t disappointed one bit. In 13 games so far, the former Turkish League MVP has put up 15.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.2 blocks, and 0.6 steals compared to last season when he averaged 9.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 0.9 blocks, and 0.8 steals. That’s obviously a big improvement, and his efficiency has gone up across the board as well. Maybe Kevin Porter jr. could have a case, but his field goal percentage has actually gone down with a bigger role. Sengun has both been given increased opportunity to succeed and taken full advantage of it.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>It’s simply absurd how much has happened over 4 short weeks. It feels like every other day there’s some new headlining story, and I’m glad the Rockets have been able to stay out of most of the drama. I have been very impressed with some players and let down by others, but that’s to be expected with a rebuilding team. This year is crucial in determining the long-term roster, and everybody is fighting hard to secure their spot. It’s nice to be able to give credit where credit is due after a long and grueling month. I can’t wait to see the organization continue to evolve and watch these young guys develop while eventually starting to win games. The franchise has a lot of talent, they just have to make it all work together. These days will soon be considered the good-ol’ days, so I’m gonna savor them now while I can.</p>
