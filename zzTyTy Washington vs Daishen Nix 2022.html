        <h1>Daishen Nix vs TyTy Washington Jr: The Battle For The Backup Point Guard Spot Next Season</h1>
        <p>After the Rockets traded for the 29th overall pick, TyTy Washington Jr., a question appeared about who would have the role of backup point guard on the team next season, “Him or Daishen Nix?” Before the draft, it seemed clear that Nix would be the other bench guard, receiving about 15 minutes per game, alongside Josh Christopher, but now that reality is no longer guaranteed. It would be odd for the Rockets to use a first-round pick on a player and not give him a chance to earn minutes. So, they must decide which of the two will fill that role and what to do with the other one. </p>
        <h2>The Case For Daishen Nix:</h2>
        <p>First off, Nix has been with the team for longer and posted better stats in Summer League. In about the same number of minutes, Nix averaged 13.4 points, 4.4 assists, 3.4 rebounds, and 1.6 steals, while Washington averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 assists, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.8 steals over 5 games. Albeit this was a small sample size under irregular conditions compared to NBA games, numbers don’t lie. Nix also had better efficiency across the board.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the organization views him as a lottery pick type talent, so why would they give a late first round selection minutes over a “lottery talent.” The coaches saw what Daishen was capable of last season with the Vipers, where he posted impressive averages of 20.6 points, 7.7 assists, 5.9 rebounds, and 2 steals per game during his 33 minutes of work over 18 total games. His numbers also increased pretty significantly in the playoffs. Compare that to TyTy Washington, who remains relatively unproven to this point, and you can see why Nix may be the obvious choice. </p>
        <p>Lastly, he is younger, probably has more potential, and currently is more adjusted to the NBA level. In Summer League, Nix looked in control and comfortable, while Washington seemed a bit reckless occasionally. It’s going to take some time for the recent 29th overall pick to become acclimated to all the new challenges in the NBA, hence it may be safer and easier to go with Nix. Right now, he appears to be ahead on paper but better stay committed to retain that spot.</p>
        <h2>The Case For TyTy Washington:</h2>
        <p>The data from Summer League may point towards Dashien Nix for this position, but the numbers are a bit skewed. Nix was given more opportunity as the primary ball handler and Washington has better athleticism, defense, and ball handling, stuff that doesn’t necessarily show up on the stat sheet. He is also better at creating his own shot and being a pest to opposing guards. On top of that, Nix is more of a traditional point guard who needs the ball in his hands to succeed, whereas Washington can move off ball and around screens much easier, which is something that the Rockets need.</p>
        <p>As mentioned before, the team didn’t trade for Washington if they had no interest in utilizing his skillset. Rafael Stone made that move for a reason, and maybe that is for him to be the team’s new backup point guard. Washington also fell significantly in the draft, with some people having him go as high as pick 11 to the Knicks. To get him at 29, was an absolute steal that should not be taken for granted. He also played for Kentucky, which is an elite school that is known for producing many high-level, NBA talents.</p>
        <p>Finally, there must be a reason that Nix went undrafted. Maybe there are certain significant flaws to his game that I am not currently aware of. It almost seems too good to be true. It could be better for the organization to play the guy they drafted with a first-round pick rather than the guy nobody wanted. Nix may have shown promise in the g-league, but that doesn’t always translate. In fact, look up the last 10 or so g-league Mvps and I promise you won't have heard of a majority of them.</p>
        <h2>The Bottom Line: </h2>
        <p>Both guys are very skilled at basketball and are undoubtably deserving of the backup point guard position. However, one edges out the other, and right now that is Dashien Nix. TyTy Washington should certainly be given a chance to earn that spot over the course of the season, but hasn’t shown enough yet for me to pick him. Nix will be able to facilitate the second unit similar to Dennis Schroder from last season and still has tons of untapped potential. Despite that, the spot is not guaranteed for one player or the other in any way and I expect both to play better because of it.</p>
