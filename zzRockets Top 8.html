        <h1>Ranking the Top 8 Rockets' Players Talent-Wise Before the Start of the 2022-2023 Season</h1>
        <p>With preseason officially here, the tip-off for the Rockets’ first 2022-2023 regular season game is only a couple of weeks away. With the excitement continuing to build and the roster sort of being set in place, I wanted to rank the top 8 players on this team solely on their talents right now. This list is by no means a projection in any way, but just straight up my opinion of the 8 best players currently on the Houston Rockets. The order also doesn’t take into account anything from before last season, as I want to keep this as up to date as possible. It will be interesting to see how much this list changes over the next year, but for now here are my top 8 Houston Rockets heading into the 2022-2023 season.</p>
        <h2>#1 - Jalen Green</h2>
        <p>No surprises here. Jalen Green is not only our best player now, but it seems like it will be that way for a long time. He went on a tear towards the end of last season and hopefully will continue that success into this one. There’s even been thoughts on the possibility of him making the all-star team, even though he’s only in year two. Side note, if you want to read my article on how realistic this actually is, click <a href="zzJalen Green All-Star.html">here</a>. He was expected to perform at a high level and certainly has been. We all knew the 2021 NBA draft was loaded with talent, and when we received the number 2 overall pick, it was hard to go wrong. Green also made the All-Rookie first team last year and averaged the most points from any rookie, outside of Cade Cunningham by a 0.1 difference.</p>
        <h2>#2 - Eric Gordon</h2>
        <p>Eric Gordon is the last remaining member from the “James Harden era” and there's a good reason for it. Last year, he was a consistent veteran presence who could pull out a win when the team needed one. Gordon can hit the three at a high percentage, take guys off the dribble, and be one of the best defenders on the team, all in the same game. Being 33, he has a lot of experience at the NBA level, which is more useful than you would initially think. Even though he seems like an obvious trade piece, the Rockets know that without a player like him, their team would be a disaster on some nights. He knows what he needs to do, and mostly sticks to that, while everybody else is constantly trying to experiment and improve their skills.</p>
        <h2>#3 - Kevin Porter Jr.</h2>
        <p>KPJ is now the best point guard within the organization, with the recent departure of John Wall, and is starting to play like it. He already looks way more comfortable with the ball in his hands, just from the first preseason game, and is only going to get better. I wouldn’t put him above Gordon or Green yet, because he still, sometimes, has those moments that make you want to stop watching. However, Porter is still a lot more proven than some of the guys below him. There are definitely a lot of aspects of his game for him to work on, but the future looks bright. With an extension looming, we’re either going to see the best or worst version of him yet, which naturally may be a good thing or a bad one.</p>
        <h2>#4 - Alperen Sengun</h2>
        <p>Having Sengun this high may be a little questionable, but let me explain. Last season he showed flashes of greatness, at times, but was stuck behind Christian Wood in the rotation. Now, he’s for sure going to start, and I think that was a great decision for the future. Alongside Jabari Smith Jr, in the frontcourt, Sengun is going to have plenty of space to work his magic, and I can’t wait to see how it plays out. He was also very impressive in the EuroBasket league, being Turkey’s leading scorer and top player overall. It is clear now that Sengun is a lot more adjusted to the NBA, than last year, and his play should and will reflect that. Just imagine having to travel halfway across the world to an entirely new country in which you don’t speak the language, and having to compete playing basketball at the highest level night in and night out. Not to mention the fact that he was only 19 years old.</p>
        <h2>#5 - Jae’sean Tate</h2>
        <p>Here’s another guy that might be 1 or 2 spots higher on my list than many others, considering he’s in the top 5 without being projected as a starter. This is simply due to the fact that the guys below him are less proven at the NBA level. Tate is an all-around type player who really works hard when he’s out on the court. The former All-Rookie first team member is also a guy that helps this team win games. His impact may not show up as much on the stat sheet, but it is definitely known to the people that watch him play every few nights. I can’t put him any higher because he’s just not a guy that can run the offense. Tate needs other players around him to run the plays while being a facilitator of them. You can’t just give him the ball and tell him to get himself a quality shot, unlike the 4 guys above him.</p>
        <h2>#6 - Jabari Smith Jr.</h2>
        <p>Being a rookie, Jabari Smith Jr. has a lot to show everyone before I can put him any higher. We all know what he did in college, but there are all-time greats at the collegiate level that never pan out in the NBA. It was different for Jalen Green, coming from the G-league, because he was able to become, at least somewhat, acclimated to the new competition before his official first season. Smith is a good shooter and defender, but has yet to display expertise in any other area. This is natural though, as top lottery picks are expected to develop a lot of their skillset after making it to the NBA. Right now, the former All-American is mainly a player with a bunch of potential and a lot to work on. He’s almost certainly going to climb this list over the years, but for now this is where I have him ranked based on his current talents.</p>
        <h2>#7 - Tari Eason</h2>
        <p>Tari Eason is a rookie as well, but is certainly the most polished out of the three Rockets’ first round picks. Now that doesn’t mean there’s not room for improvement, just that he is the most complete player as of now. So, you may be wondering why I have him ranked below Smith. I’ll be honest and say that it was very close for me between these two, as we have yet to see either play in a regular season game just yet. I put Jabari above Eason for the fact that he is a better shooter and can get his own points when he needs to. Smith is going to start and Eason is likely not, and there has to be a reason for that. It just didn’t feel right ranking the #17 overall pick ahead of the #3 overall pick before the season has even begun. Smith is projected to have a more impressive rookie season, so for now I’m sticking with him as much as I love Eason.</p>
        <h2>#8 - Josh Christopher</h2>
        <p>Rounding out the list is none other than Josh Christopher himself. Christopher pretty much forced his way into the rotation because of how well he was playing in the G-league, and I see no reason to doubt him now. Other players I considered for this spot were KJ Martin Jr., and Garrison Matthews, which probably would’ve been my number 9 and 10, respectively. I chose Christopher because of his impact on defense. Both Mattews and Martin are only members of this team for their offensive abilities, outside of the occasional block from Martin. Christopher, on the other hand, is a pest to opposing guards and gives 100% of his effort at all times. He is younger and is likely going to be ahead of both of the other guys in the rotation, so it makes the most logical sense to rank him higher.</p>
