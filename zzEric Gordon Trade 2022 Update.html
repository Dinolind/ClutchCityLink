        <h1>An Update On the Houston Rockets' Eric Gordon Trade Situation (Mock Trades)</h1>
        <p>December 15th is the first official day of the “NBA trade season” because it is the first time that players signed in the off-season can be dealt. I have a feeling that this year, different organizations around the league are going to make transactions sooner, rather than wait for the trade deadline. The Houston Rockets presumably only have 1 player on the trade block: Eric Gordon. It’s a miracle that he’s still around after the entire roster has been gutted over the past few years. Everybody knows that he takes up too many minutes, isn’t a part of the long-term future, and wants to win a championship, so it’s time for EG to move on. Below are some mock trades to facilitate this process.</p>
        <h2>Trade #1</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Evan Fournier, Cam Reddish, 2023 1st round pick via New York (Lottery Protected)</h4>
        <h4>Knicks receive: Eric Gordon</h4>
        <p>I think this trade is interesting from both perspectives. The Rockets are taking on Evan Fournier’s contract, but are compensated fairly with a 1st round pick and Cam Reddish. Besides, there is a team option on said contract that the organization can decline for the 2024-2025 season. Although I don’t know if a buyout is even possible with Fournier, it seems like a good idea in theory. Let him come here for this season as a veteran and then decide if he’s worth keeping. The extra pick can also be an asset used in a future trade, and Cam Reddish, who has been in the trade block for a while, is a good piece to bring off the bench. Who knows, maybe Houston is the place he will finally blossom into the player he was projected to be.</p>
        <p>The Knicks have made their intentions to win now known across the league by signing Jalen Brunson and extending RJ Barrett. Eric Gordon helps with this a lot. Fournier is having a bad year so far, and it may be time to get rid of him while they can. Like I said before, Reddish is also not viewed by them as essential anymore. The starting lineup of Jalen Brunson, Eric Gordon, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson gives them a real chance to make the playoffs and possibly go even further. Even if they do lose too many games, they still have their 1st round pick, with it being lottery protected, in an absolutely loaded draft. New York needs to make a move to ensure their spot in the top 8 teams of the Eastern Conference, and this could be exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
        <h2>Trade #2</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Rui Hachimura, Will Barton</h4>
        <h4>Wizards receive: Eric Gordon</h4>
        <p>First off, the Rockets get Will Barton on an expiring contract, who can play some spot minutes off the bench and provide a decent veteran presence. This would preserve their cap space this off-season without having to deal with any tension between Eric Gordon by not fully guaranteeing his salary. The real reason the Rockets agree to this trade, though, is for Rui Hachimura. His value is currently at about a late first round pick, except he’s already been in the league for a few and still has the potential to be much more. I’m intrigued by him because of his diverse skill set and the fact that he shot nearly 45% from deep last season on about 3 attempts per game. The roster could certainly use somebody like that. We also need a backup Power Forward if Usman Garuba is going to continue being used as a Center.</p>
        <p>I think Eric Gordon is an upgrade for the Wizard’s sixth man role, and they don’t even have to give up any draft capital. Gordon can lead the second unit and keep their team in the game while Bradely Beal is on the bench. He also improves their defense and helps them continue to battle for a playoff spot. Hachimura and Deni Avdija have been on the trade block after consistently underperforming for a while, so there’s no love lost there. If Washington still doesn’t want to blow their roster, this could be a transaction for them to make. It has become clear that they need to act now before it’s too late and Bradley Beal’s prime is over. This could be the first step for them in becoming legitimate contenders, rather than a team stuck in mediocrity. Let’s just hope for their fans that something is done, whether it be this or another trade with a different team. They need to start cashing in on their young assets that haven’t worked out so far.</p>
        <h2>Trade #3</h2>
        <h4>Rockets receive: Reggie Bullock, Dwight Powell, 2025 2nd round pick via Dallas (Unprotected), 2027 2nd round pick via Dallas (Unprotected)</h4>
        <h4>Mavericks receive: Eric Gordon, Bruno Fernando</h4>
        <p>Houston gets Dwight Powell on an expiring contract to run some backup center in place of Bruno Fernando temporarily. Also, Reggie Bullock is another wing to utilize off the bench in the event that Jae’Sean Tate remains out for an extended period of time. Bullock does have a second year on his deal after this season, but it is only half guaranteed for a total value of $5,451,200. That’s cheap enough to either keep him around or simply waive him. Additionally, the 2 seconds are far enough out to be used as liquid assets to secure a big transaction in the future. I believe that Bruno Fernando is going to lose minutes to Usman Garuba as the season progresses, and may need to find a new home. With Powell it will all be over and done with by April rather than dragging out this 4-center experiment that isn’t going to work long-term.</p>
        <p>Dallas acquires a lob threat that Luca Doncic desperately needs, and Eric Gordon to potentially start over Tim Hardaway Jr. or provide a spark off the bench. Gordon already has some chemistry with Christian Wood from their time together here in Houston, so that is another positive. He also knows how to play off of a ball-dominant superstar because of his years spent with James Harden. Dwight Powell has been on the trade block since the start of the season, and Reggie Bullock is having a bad year. At the end of the day, those 2 seconds aren’t going to mean much for the Mavericks, who should be a playoff team for a while after signing Doncic to a 5 year contract. The Mavericks are another team who aren’t really true contenders just yet. They need to upgrade their roster to even have a chance against an increasingly competitive Western Conference. Something like this could help them.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>As you can probably tell, I think it’s reasonable to place Gordon’s value at about a mid-to-late first round pick. He’s a veteran that can still play at a high level, but doesn’t have the ability to be the 2nd or even 3rd best player on a championship team at this stage in his career. I know the front office doesn’t want to take back any bad contracts that extend past this season, and wants to receive some sort of value in return. The biggest problem with trying to construct trades is the massive contract that is attached to his name. Luckily, it’s basically expiring money, so that helps a lot. I think I would be happy with any transaction that provides either a younger player who hasn’t proven himself at the NBA level, or a protected first round pick without absorbing unwanted salary. Rafael Stone has put off an Eric Gordon trade for long enough, and it’s time for the latter to go compete and win a ring. It would be a shame if we passed yet another trade deadline without anything happening.</p>
