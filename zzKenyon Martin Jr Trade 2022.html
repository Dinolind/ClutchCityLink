        <h1>4 Kenyon Martin Jr Potential Trade Scenarios In 2022 To Fulfill His Request</h1>
        <p>Per Kelly Iko of The Athletic, Kenyon Martin Jr officially requested a trade from the Houston Rockets in June because he believed that there would be little to no minutes available to him next season. Despite the fact that several teams have been interested in him, Martin still remains on the roster. Some may argue that the relationship has been salvaged between him and the team, but I believe that with training camp inching closer, the Rockets need to find a move sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>First off, Martin’s value is difficult to judge. On paper, he seems like a young, promising prospect with loads of potential, but it is possible that he is just someone who puts up empty stats on a bad team. He could be worth anywhere from two firsts to barely anything depending on who you ask. I fall somewhere towards the lower end of the spectrum. While Martin is definitely fun to watch, he hasn’t shown enough at this point for other teams to fork over significant assets to acquire him.</p>
        <p>However, he is on a very team-friendly contract and may thrive in the right situation. The Trailblazers and Nets have reported interest in Martin and the Raptors are another great candidate as well. These teams look to add some young talent to their lineup while the Rockets are most likely hoping to receive another player to come off the bench and possibly some future draft capital. Without further ado, consider the following trades as my attempt to define appropriate value for Kenyon Martin Jr. </p>
        <h2>Trade #1</h2>
        <h4>Rockets Receive: Svi Mykhailiuk, 2023 1st round pick via Toronto (Lottery Protected)</h4>
        <h4>Raptors Receive: Kenyon Martin Jr.</h4>
        <p>The Rockets get Svi Mykhailiuk who could be a solid bench piece this upcoming season while being on an expiring contract. In addition, the extra 1st could help the team add an additional player to help ensure their 2024 projected leap in the standings. This trade is a straightforward way to deal Martin without too many repercussions, so if that is the Rockets’ main goal then it should be a no-brainer. This trade might not be the best way to maximize Martin’s value, but there is certainty value in easily resolving a situation before it gets worse.</p>
        <p>Toronto acquires a young player to fit the timeline while not having to break the bank. Mykhailiuk only averaged about 12 minutes per game last season, which will simply be replaced by Kenyon Martin. The Raptors shouldn’t have any interest in adding another mid to late first round pick to their roster next season, so parting ways with a lottery protected pick isn’t the end of the world. Martin helps the Raptors continue to grow their young core around Scottie Barnes, Gary Trent Jr., and OG Anunoby and gives them a scoring lift next season. The Raptors are looking to compete, and this trade can certainly help that while also not messing up their future.</p>
        <h2>Trade #2</h2>
        <h4>Rockets Receive: Seth Curry</h4>
        <h4>Nets Receive: David Nwaba, Kenyon Martin Jr., 2024 2nd round pick via Brooklyn from Houston (Unprotected)</h4>
        <p>Seth Curry is a great option for the Rockets to replace Eric Gordon should he be traded and more floor spacing is never a bad thing. He doesn’t exactly fit the timeline for the team but is on a one-year contract. David Nwaba is expendable with younger players looking to take his spot and allowing Brooklyn to regain control of their 2024 second may be the trading chip that makes this transaction go through. Whether Curry is flipped at the deadline or kept for the long-term future having another quality, 3 and D wing is something every team should want.</p>
        <p>The Nets may strive to get some youth back on the roster if Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are traded before the start of the season. Getting a young guy and your own 2nd round pick back is a step in the right direction for a potential rebuild. Seth Curry might leave for nothing next season so now might be the time for the Nets to get what they can. Everything is kind of up in the air right now for the organization, but given the proper scenario, a trade like this doesn’t seem too unlikely.</p>
        <h2>Trade #3</h2>
        <h4>Rockets Receive: Keon Johnson </h4>
        <h4>Trailblazers Receive: Kenyon Martin Jr., 2024 2nd round pick via Golden State from Houston (Unprotected)</h4>
        <p>Keon Johnson is just a better, younger wing that is more suited to the Houston Rockets’ needs. He is also under his rookie contract for the next 3 seasons, which is a plus. Giving up a future second from the most recent NBA champions is for sure worth it in this scenario. Personally, I haven’t watched too much of Johnson since he got to the NBA, but he was someone I wanted the Rockets to get in the 2021 NBA Draft and now is when they have the opportunity to trade for him. Getting another up-and-coming player that will further add to the Rockets young squad while simultaneously getting rid of someone who wants out seems like an easy move.</p>
        <p>The Blazers have made it clear that their goal this offseason is to retool around Dame and this move would continue to fulfill that mission. Martin is a year older, has more experience, and posted more points per game last season than Keon Johnson so he is a clear, immediate upgrade. Furthermore, an additional second round pick may be useful in another trade, possibly for someone like Myles Turner. Johnson doesn’t fit the current team so the organization may as well ship him out in order to go all in before Lillard is past his prime.</p>
        <h2>Trade #4</h2>
        <h4>Rockets Receive: Matisse Thybulle, 2023 1st round pick via Toronto (Lottery Protected)</h4>
        <h4>Raptors Receive: Michael Frazier II (Sign and Trade), George Niang, Kenyon Martin Jr., 2024 2nd round pick via Golden State from Houston (Unprotected)</h4>
        <h4>Sixers Receive: Khem Birch </h4>
        <p>The Rockets have had their eye on Thybulle for a while now and also get a first-round pick for 2 people who likely weren’t going to be in the rotation next year and a future 2nd. Thybulle can provide some defense off the bench and we both know that Rafael Stone loves his draft picks. Martin gets to go compete for a championship with his former teammate, James Harden, and the Rockets get immense value in return. Seems like a win-win.</p>
        <p>The Raptors are sending a pick that may not convey and Khem Birch for an absolute haul in comparison. 2 rotational pieces and a 2nd round pick. The Raptors were the 5 seed last season, but, baring a Kevin Durant like move, may find themselves falling down the standings in the future due to other teams in the East improving their rosters. This move is beneficial to them whether that happens or not because in one scenario, Martin helps the Raptors make a playoff push, while in the other, the Raptors tank and retain their first-round pick while adding a young player.</p>
        <p>The sixers get a quality backup center to play behind embiid, which will greatly help them in the playoffs. It’s no secret that fans and the organization are ready to see Thybulle traded so why not now? Niang has little value and undoubtably won’t stand in the way of this trade happening. Maybe the Sixers can get an additional second from one of the teams but would still almost certainly do the trade regardless. Everything rests on next season for this organization and adding someone like Khem Birch may help them go deep in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Kenyon Martin Jr’s days are numbered with the Rockets organization. He requested a trade, and it is up to the franchise to fulfill it. No one even knows for sure that some sort of deal will go down, but my prediction is that he won’t be in Houston by the end of next season. Above all, trading players like Kenyon Martin Jr., is an unfortunate but necessary part of the Rockets eventually winning the NBA championship.</p>
