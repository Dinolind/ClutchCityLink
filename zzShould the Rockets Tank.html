        <h1>Should the Rockets Fully Embrace the Tank Next Season to Land a Top Prospect?</h1>
        <p>We’ve all seen it by now: Victor Wembenyama and Scoot Henderson absolutely dominating the game of basketball at only 18 years old. Wembenyama himself has been labeled by many as the greatest prospect since Lebron James, and Henderson would’ve been a solidified #1 overall pick and practically any other draft. So, what does this all mean for the Rockets? As a team that is currently in the rebuilding phase, having finished with the worst record in the league for the past 2 seasons, there is a realistic possibility Houston could earn another top pick.</p>
        <p>This creates the interesting dilemma of wanting to win as many games as possible while also maintaining high lottery odds. The NBA is structured in a way that you either want to be first or last, and as much as they try to disincentivize tanking, that still remains true. However, it’s hard to tell your team not to try their hardest to win now, even if it’s for the greater good. Seeing how talented these prospects are may make the decision easier for some organizations, but in the case of the Rockets it becomes a little more difficult to tell. Below are the cases for and against losing as many games as possible next season.</p>
        <h2>Bottoming Out</h2>
        <p>Wembenyama is a once-in-a-generation type talent, and it would be silly to not do everything possible to improve your chances of landing him. We’ve seen this among other teams around the league, as they have begun to ship out their talent in order to lose more games. If the Rockets can successfully accumulate 3 consecutive top 3 picks, their chances of eventually winning a championship improve drastically. It could be worth it to endure having a terrible record for one more season, in hopes of having more success when the time comes in a few years. Even the current team at full strength is, at best, fighting for the last Play-in Tournament spot with an incredibly small chance to make any noise in the playoffs. So if they aren’t going to win it all anyways, why bother trying?</p>
        <p>This is also the last year where the Rockets have their own first round pick, with the next 3 first rounders owed to the OKC Thunder from the Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul swap. This is going to be the last chance for the Rockets to add a high draft pick for some time. Therefore, it may make sense to go all in on losing for this year, as they may not have another opportunity to do so. Another reason for tanking would be that the Rockets are projected to have a ton of cap space next off-season. With a starting lineup of KPJ, Jalen Green, max free agent, Jabari Smith Jr., and Victor Wembenyama, the organization would be set for many years to come. Even if the Rockets get a different guy in the draft, the same thought process applies with just different positions or players.</p>
        <h2>Trying to Be Competitive</h2>
        <p>The Rockets’ young guys need to improve as much as possible over the next few years, and trying to win every game may be a way to accomplish that. If they decide to lose on purpose for another season, it may become ingrained in the team's culture that there's no point in winning. Plus, it’s also hard to tell all of our young and exciting players to let the other team win all of the close games. Even though they can probably understand the circumstances, it just goes against the sport of basketball to not even try. If we are at full strength, this team could surprise some people and potentially make a push for the 9th or 10th seed, which at face value should be the goal.</p>
        <p>Fans are also sick and tired of losing. If we continue to have atrocious losing streaks and little growth, they may start to turn against the organization. At the end of the day, the Rockets are a business, and if winning more games makes it more profitable, then that might be what ends up happening. The coaching staff also needs to start holding players accountable for bad plays that cost us the game, and if the intention is to lose, they can’t really do that. How can they preach that hard work pays off if we’re not trying to win. Even if the Rockets do win a few extra games, it’s not like we lose our pick entirely, either. There are still great prospects available around the 3-8 range that could help the team going forward. There's also the argument that, at this point, the organization may just simply not need the top guy in the draft to win a championship in the future.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I’m personally on the side of trying to keep the games close while still losing however many is needed to have high lottery odds. Maybe not the worst team, to avoid becoming the laughing stock of the league, but somewhere around the 2nd or 3rd worst among others. The prize of the draft is Victor Wembenyama, and no matter how many games the team loses, they will only have, at maximum, a 14% chance to get him. Under the new draft lottery rules, the same chance to get the #1 overall pick is offered to the bottom three teams, so if that’s who the franchise wants, then winning a couple more times won’t hurt anything. The young talent is ready to compete, but this season should still be focused on development. Let the rookies and sophomores develop their abilities for 1 more season, without the pressure of winning, and then go all in by adding another top prospect and lots of talent from the free agent market.</p>
