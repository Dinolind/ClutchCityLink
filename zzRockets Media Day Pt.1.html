        <h1>Houston Rockets 2022 Media Day Analysis, Summary, and Reactions Part 1</h1>
        <p>Rockets Media Day has officially concluded, and the players are looking towards training camp that begins on Tuesday, September 27th in Lake Charles, Louisiana. As promised, below are my immediate reactions to the event. The general consensus is that everyone is excited for the season to begin in order to show off all of the hard work they’ve put in over the summer. There was a lot discussed over the 3 hour livestream, so I am going to give you the short and condensed version of what really happened. We did unfortunately lose a good majority of Alperen Sengun’s interview due to technical difficulties, so I won’t be discussing that here. So, the people that we did get to hear from, in order, were: Stephen Silas, Rafael Stone, Eric Gordon, Tari Eason, Jae’Sean Tate, Jalen Green, Boban Marjanovic, Garrison Matthews, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr., Josh Christopher and Kevin Porter Jr.</p>
        <p>Here are the links to the full media day livestream:

        <h2>Stephen Silas and Raphael Stone</h2>
        <p>I’m grouping both together because that’s how it was in the interview. First off, Silas talked about how he wants to see improvement from everybody not only from year to year but from the beginning to the end of the season. Rafael Stone mentioned that he doesn’t use wins and loses as a way to determine that, and mainly wants effort from the players. Of course he didn’t want to talk about KPJ’s extension, but did say he is very excited about what this season could mean for him. Silas said that he couldn’t believe the attendance rate at off-season workouts, and is glad that they are building a hard-working culture. He wants to see better defense and for other teams to look at a game against the Rockets as a tough matchup. This is going to be a big year and I think that’s something Silas recognizes. In his eyes, defense and determination are going to be 2 big focal points this upcoming season, and I am glad to hear that.</p>
        <h2>Eric Gordon:</h2>
        <p>EG is still bought in and is willing to sacrifice for the other guys on the team. He mentions his versatility and that everybody around him has improved a lot. The biggest point for me was that he wants to retire a Rocket but also wants to win games, which is kind of contradictory at this stage in the rebuild. However, I’m betting that he probably won’t be traded based on everything we have heard so far. He also wants to set an example for other players and thinks his teammates, like KPJ, can be really good as long as they find themselves and their roles on the team. While Stone doesn’t care about the win/loss ratio as much, Gordon definitely does. He wants everyone else to make progress on their development, and for the team to become better by the end of the year. Overall, the Rockets guard, I believe, is here to stay and is going to help the team win more games again when they are ready to compete.</p>
        <h2>Tari Eason: </h2>
        <p>Eason says he has, and wants to continue to, learn as a player, mainly from Stephen Silas. He is going to bring more energy to an already flashy roster, and hopes everyone can come together, work hard, and bring success back to Houston. The recent 17th overall pick also comments on his defensive adaptability, going back to what Silas said earlier, and how much he works on his game. The main goal he has for himself is growth, which I think is good considering he is a rookie that just made it to the NBA. Eason wraps up by mentioning that he is glad to be in Houston, which of course he is going to say. I think it’ll be interesting to see exactly what his role is going to be, but whatever it is, I’m excited to watch his rookie season unfold.</p>
        <h2>Jae’Sean Tate:</h2>
        <p>Tate has worked a lot on his shot, mainly corner threes, but still doesn't consider it a main part of his game. Instead, he’d rather be an all-around type player. He says this year should be easier since he’s been here before, and that he has learned a lot from the last two years. He throws out the idea of Tari Eason being compared to him skillset wise, which is funny because those two guys are likely going to be competing for the same minutes. Tate describes the culture as electric, which means they are going to be a very dangerous, fast and athletic team that plays hard. Other organizations aren’t going to want to face the Rockets, which ties back to what Stephen Silas said at the beginning. The fact that the Rockets need to “keep on, keepin’ on” with more praise for his teammates, like Alperen Sengun, pretty much concluded his availability.
        </p>
        <h2>Jalen Green</h2>
        <p>Here’s the big one. The person fans have been dying to hear from. Jalen Green is fully bought in and is thrilled to be a part of this young core. He wants to build off of the success he had at the end of last season while becoming a lot better on the defensive side of the ball. He is looking to be a leader for the incoming rookies and to become an all-star. The big thing was that he worked on catch and shoot opportunities, ball-handling, pick-and-roll, isolations, and getting to his spots over the summer. He says this group has a good mentality and good chemistry, and has added a surprising 10 pounds of muscle over the off-season. His main goal is improvement, not only for this season but further down the line. Plus, he expects this team to be one of the best in the league before too long. I think it’s good that he’s optimistic and willing to work for results. So many guys in his situation would want out of a losing team, but he is fully committed and willing to do anything he can in order to bring the Rockets back to their former glory.
        </p>
        <h2>Boban Marjanovic</h2>
        <p>Marjanovic probably has the least amount of importance to the Rockets going forward, but that doesn’t mean his interview wasn’t at least entertaining. He mentioned how he’s a good human being and that he is going to help and support his teammates. He thinks this’ll be a good year with a good group, and he is very happy about that. There is then more praise for Alperen Sengun and Stephen Silas, who he is excited to be reunited with after Silas left Dallas a few years back. Finally, he says his impact is more than just basketball and that he’s a good locker room guy who can help everybody work together like a team. I think Boban is a good person to keep around now, but may be gone as soon as things start to get serious. I love his personality, and the Rockets need a big guy on the roster. However, I think eventually he will end up somewhere else.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I am actually going to split this into 2 parts just to make sure this article isn’t outrageously long. So, here’s the link to part 2 (Coming Soon). I just found the recording of Sengun’s interview, so I’ll go over him along with the remaining people I haven’t talked about yet. So far, I can’t wait for the start of the season and am pleased to hear that a focus is being placed on defense. You can score as many points as you want to, but if you can’t stop the other team, then you’re out of luck. This roster seems to have a lot more sense of comradery than last year, and that is another good thing as well. Talent does not always equal success; you have to have chemistry to go along with it. We learned that from the Brooklyn Nets. The first preseason game is on October 2nd, which is less than a week away, and hopefully we’ll see what’s been talked about actually put into action.</p>
