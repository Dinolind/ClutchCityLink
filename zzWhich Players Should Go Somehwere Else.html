        <h1>Which Players Should the Rockets Get Rid of to Cut Their Roster Down to the Maximum of 15</h1>
        <p>The stage is set for the regular season to begin, but before that can happen, the Rockets roster is going to lose some members. NBA teams are allowed a maximum of 15 players on standard contracts and 2 players on two-way contracts. Right now, the Rockets have 18 people on their roster plus Trevor Hudgins, who is currently on a two-way deal. This means they do have one two-way spot available, but also need to get rid of 3 guys on the regular roster. So, you may be wondering who the realistic options are. Well, here’s a list of players that probably won’t be one of them:</p>
        <h4>Jalen Green</h4>
        <h4>Kevin Porter Jr.</h4>
        <h4>TyTy Washington Jr.</h4>
        <h4>Eric Gordon</h4>
        <h4>Garrison Matthews</h4>
        <h4>Daishen Nix</h4>
        <h4>Josh Christopher</h4>
        <h4>Jae’Sean Tate</h4>
        <h4>Bruno Fernando</h4>
        <h4>Tari Eason</h4>
        <h4>Jabari Smith Jr.</h4>
        <h4>Boban Marjanovic</h4>
        <h4>Alperen Sengun</h4>
        <p>That leaves Theo Maledon, Maurice Harkless, Derrick Favors, Kenyon Martin Jr., and Usman Garuba as potential options. 3 out of 5 will likely no longer be a part of this team by October 19th, the deadline to make this decision, but it’s just a matter of who it’ll be. Below is the current situation for all of these players along with my predictions on their chances of staying in Houston.</p>
        <h2>Theo Maledon</h2>
        <p>It would certainly surprise me if Theo Maledon was a Houston Rocket by the start of the season. He was a fill-in piece as a part of the recent 8-player trade with the OKC Thunder, and I don’t believe there was ever any intention of keeping him with the team. He is currently about to enter year 3 of a 4-year contract worth around $8 million in total. However, this is the final year of guaranteed money as there is a team option in 2023. At such a small number, it’s easy to waive him over the next couple of weeks. Unless something changes, this is exactly what I expect the organization to do.</p>
        <h2>Maurice Harkless</h2>
        <p>Maurice Harkless is in a similar situation to Maledon in that he was another player thrown into the same transaction. Again, I don’t see him remaining with the team much longer. None of the fans have any kind of attachment to him, unlike some other guys, and he is also on an expiring contract. He is supposed to make $4,564,980, though, so it would cost the franchise more money than Maledon to simply waive him. Nevertheless, I still think that will happen. He just doesn’t fit into what the Rockets are trying to build and doesn’t have much trade value, so I see no reason to keep him.</p>
        <h2>Derrick Favors</h2>
        <p>Derrick Favors is the last of the players Houston received in the recent transaction that still remains on the roster, but his situation is a little bit different. First off, he is on an expiring contract that is much more substantial than the other 2, at just over $10 million dollars for this season. It would cost the organization a lot more just to cut him. Plus, he could be an asset to flip at the trade deadline, or to be kept around to create more cap space for the organization next off-season. Favors is the only person, from this trade, that I believe has a chance of staying on this team, but he’s not a lock by any means.</p>
        <h2>Kenyon Martin Jr.</h2>
        <p>There’s one person that has explicitly said he no longer wants to be in Houston, and that’s Kenyon Martin Jr. Although he probably is the most talented of the guys on this list, why not take this as an opportunity to ship him off before the relationship becomes worse. Of course, this would have to be done pretty soon, and another team would have to be willing to give up something the Rockets want to make it happen. If he isn’t moved in a deal, I don’t think he’ll be the one to go. He’s just too good for that. We’ll see how it all plays out, but I believe there’s still a role for Matin in the lineup, unlike a majority of the other names up for consideration.</p>
        <h2>Usman Garuba</h2>
        <p>I personally think it’s way too early to give up on Usman Garuba, given the fact he was a project pick to begin with, but the organization may view him in a different way. He hasn’t shown very much at the NBA level since being drafted, and might soon become the odd man out. They did just recently pick up the team option on his contract for 2023, so that could be a good sign, but who really knows. Garuba may find himself behind Bruno Fernando in the rotation, meaning there will be extremely limited minutes for him on this team. I don’t foresee the organization cutting ties with him just yet, but I think this is the first time they’re really having to contemplate it.</p>
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        <p>My prediction is that Rafael Stone and the rest of the front office either already have a move lined up or are actively searching for one. Maledon and Harkless are going to be gone, but as for who the third player will be is hard to say. All 3 remaining options are too valuable to just cut or buyout at this point in time, so I’m interested to see what happens. Worse comes to worse, Derrick Favors is going to be the first to go between him, Garuba, and Martin, in my opinion. Although, I just don’t see them getting rid of those 3 guys unless there’s an offer on the table that they just can’t refuse. All I’m saying now is don’t be surprised when we get news of another trade just before the start of the season.</p>
