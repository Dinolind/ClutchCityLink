        <h1>What Changes Need to be Made to the Houston Rocket's Starting Lineup?</h1>
        <p>The Houston Rockets have a serious problem with their starting lineup. It feels like every game the opposing team jumps out to a double digit lead early in the first quarter, and the bench has to battle their way back from a huge deficit. For reference here are the last few games and the starting score:</p>
        <h4>11/30 Score: 13 Denver, 2 Rockets</h4>
        <h4>12/2 Score: 12 Phoenix, 2 Rockets</h4>
        <h4>12/3 Score: 15 Warriors, 2 Rockets</h4>
        <h4>12/5 Score: 10 76ers, 0 Rockets</h4>
        <p>There’s obviously a pattern. In fact, on December 2nd against the Suns, where the Rockets won, every single starter had a negative plus-minus while every single bench player had a positive one. That’s no coincidence. The bench is what won Houston that game, not the guys who are supposed to be better than them. Clearly some changes have to be made. If the guys receiving less minutes are outperforming others who are receiving more, then that needs to be fixed. It isn’t sustainable to have a comeback win be your only way to outscore the other team by the time the final buzzer sounds. Below are some suggestions for possible starting lineups that should be tested.</p>
        <h2>Benching Eric Gordon</h2>
        <h4>Possible Lineup: KPJ, Green, Martin, Smith, Sengun</h4>
        <p>This is the simplest and most called for answer. Eric Gordon is not a part of the future core in Houston, and as a result, shouldn’t be receiving 30+ minutes per game. The argument that he is the Rocket’s best player has faded away, but for some reason he is still being treated as such. It’s not like Gordon is helping the team win anyways. The numbers suggest that his impact on the floor is lackluster at best, and he certainly doesn’t help the development of the young guys playing behind him. Maybe the best option is to experiment with KJ Martin in the starting lineup. Martin has a better overall net rating and can help push the pace on both offense and defense. The Rockets need to play fast and having Gordon in the starting lineup greatly hinders that.</p>
        <h2>Goon Squad</h2>
        <h4>Possible Lineup: KPJ, Green, Martin, Eason, Garuba</h4>
        <p>This possibility is a little far-fetched, but it definitely has its upsides. The Goon Squad plays with a positive net rating of 0.1 with this variation and a net rating of 2.5 with Diashen Nix instead of KPJ. Compare that to the starters, who have a net rating of -13.7, and it becomes evident which lineup is more effective. Martin, Garuba, and Eason also play at a considerably higher pace than Gordon, Smith, and Sengun do, which fits the culture this young team is trying to build. I get the argument that Jabari Smith Jr. should be starting because he was a top 3 pick, but the numbers don’t lie and he may actually benefit from being the focal point of the second unit alongside Alperen Sengun in the frontcourt. We’ve seen this concept work successfully with Benedict Mathurin, who has only started one game, yet is arguably the best rookie so far outside of Paolo Banchero.</p>
        <h2>Experimentation</h2>
        <h4>Possible Lineup: Nix, Green, Eason, Martin, Sengun</h4>
        <p>This looks ridiculous on paper I know, however, we need to experiment with new ideas. Both Tari Eason and Daishen Nix have had extreme success in the recent games with their respective lineups, and Martin and Sengun are known for having excellent chemistry with one another. This lineup has the perfect balance of defense, shooting, shot-creation, and hustle. I know it’s probably never going to happen, but it would certainly be interesting to watch. Even the bench with KPJ, Eric Gordon, Jae’Sean Tate, Jabari Smith Jr., and Bruno Fernando/Usman Garuba sounds lethal. The defense would be incredible. This would also help from a developmental perspective. Eason, Sengun, and Nix would all get the chance to start, and potentially close out, games, gaining them valuable experience.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>My point with all of this is to switch some things up. The trio of Matin, Eason, and Garuba has been incredible, and deserves a chance in the starting lineup. Now is the time to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks because next season we actually have to start winning games. The more the Rockets experiment with now, the more prepared they will be to make those tough decisions when the time comes. I’m sick of watching the same 5 players be absolutely disastrous and then the bench fights their way back into games, and are not rewarded with more minutes. Eric Gordon should be traded or removed from the starting lineup immediately, and more players should be given opportunities to succeed. Right now is a big test on how many adjustments Stephen Silas is willing to make, and if he continues down the same path, his time could soon end in Houston.</p>
