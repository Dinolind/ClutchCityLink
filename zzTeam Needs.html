        <h1>Team Needs the Houston Rockets May Want To Address If They Desire To Win More Games</h1>
        <p>The Rockets are at an interesting point in the timeline of their rebuild. This is now the 3rd year where they are presumably tanking in hopes of landing a top prospect. So far, through two weeks of the season, this seems to be the case. The games have been tough to watch, as the Rockets currently have a record of 1-6. It feels like every game they are just 1 run away from winning, but ultimately lose because one of their many flaws gets exposed. The biggest issue is trying to figure out whether or not to address these flaws. On one hand, the fans want to see the team win, but on the other, you risk ruining lottery odds. If they were to attempt to fix some issues, here are some deficiencies with the roster they should look to remedy first.</p>
        <h2>No “Real” Big Man</h2>
        <p>It has become clear that the Rockets just don’t have a traditional center that can play consistent minutes. Sengun is 6 '11", but doesn’t defend very well inside, Bruno Fernando is only 6 '10", and Usman Garuba is even shorter at 6 '8". This becomes an issue when they have to face off against top NBA bigs like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, or Nikola Jokic. We saw this happen a few nights ago against the Bucks when Antetokounmpo put up 44 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 assists in only 28 minutes. Imagine if he had played closer to 40. Most of our centers are offensive-based, and Usman Garuba, the best defender of the bunch, just isn’t big enough to contend with some other players down low. Boban Marjonovic certainly is big enough, but doesn’t get enough minutes to really make an impact. We need a center to back up Sengun or Fernando that can slow down the other team in the paint. Somebody like Rudy Gobert, but obviously not to his caliber. Maybe package Garuba and Eric Gordon to achieve this, unless the organization is already ready to decide between Sengun and Fernando, which in this case you would trade one of them. This is why there were lots of Rumors suggesting the Rockets were going to sign Nic Claxton, but unfortunately it didn’t happen.</p>
        <h2>A Consistent Wing Starter</h2>
        <p>Eric Gordon is great for what he is, but he doesn’t play back-to-backs nor does he really fit what the team needs. The Rockets need a player that is the unquestioned starter at the small forward position. This was supposed to be Jae’Sean Tate, but for some reason we aren’t seeing that happen. If Kenyon Martin Jr. still wants to be traded, then that’s how you make it happen. If the Rockets wanted to win more games, they would make a trade for someone that can fill the same role that Gordon Hayward does for the Charlotte Hornets. A collection of Eric Gordon, Kenyon Martin Jr, another young player, and a first round pick could get you somebody decent. It’s hard for everybody to get adjusted to their new role if it’s constantly changing. Solidifying the 5th starter would go a long way in trying to fix that. However, I’m not sure I would advise the organization to do this. Giving everybody an opportunity to earn a starting spot could be a good thing in the long run, and Eric Gordon is a good guy to keep on the roster. This may be something to take another look at next season, on the condition that it is not addressed through the draft or free agency, which is likely to happen.</p>
        <h2>A Traditional Point Guard</h2>
        <p>Kevin Porter Jr. has been doing well in the first few games of the season, but there have been way too many turnovers per game for my liking. This was especially bad against the Trailblazers. The problem is, the Rockets have no one they can give the ball to that they know can facilitate a well-orchestrated play. Eventually, this should be KPJ, but he’s just not at that level yet. The best example of someone who is, would be Chris Paul, whom most Rockets’ fans should know from his time spent in Houston. Jalen Green may also work better with more of a pass-first guard alongside him. I like the backcourt of him and KPJ long-term, but it does pose an issue right now. A lot of development is going to have to take place for those two to be the starting backcourt a few years in the future. If the team wants to win right now, they should go out and get someone like Ricky Rubio, who is a great facilitator and not a liability on defense. I would not recommend this move now or even in the future; however, doing everything possible to win more now has a direct correlation to worsening our chances at a title, when the time comes; it’s how the NBA is structured, and the Rockets should and will make their moves accordingly.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>2 weeks into the season is typically when we see the last few trades take place before franchises just wait until the trade deadline. Everybody has seen what’s wrong with the team, and I don’t predict we will see any transactions made to fix the issues, suggesting the Rockets still want to lose a good majority of games this season. Next year is hopefully when Rafael Stone will start being more aggressive in pursuit of being competitive. It’s just not the time to go all in just yet. Improvement is going to be the main focus for the remainder of the season, and, to be honest, it should be. As much as I hate watching the team lose over and over again every few nights, I have to remind myself that it’s for the greater good. This article was made to explain why we are losing so many games, and why it may be a good thing to ignore faults on both offense and defense. We are almost to the end of this rebuild, and I can’t wait to see it all come together. Too bad we can’t worry about what the team needs now, and have to suffer through losing for the time being.</p>
