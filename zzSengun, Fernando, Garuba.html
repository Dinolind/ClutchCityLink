        <h1>Who's the Odd Man Out Between Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba, and Bruno Fernando?</h1>
        <p>The Houston Rockets have a bit of a dilemma when it comes to their center rotation. Three guys have all shown that they are worthy of minutes: Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba, and Bruno Fernando, yet only 2 of them can actually play on a consistent basis. There’s also Boban Marjonovic, who is still on the roster but probably not in consideration for a real role in the lineup. Ideally, the starting center would get about 30 minutes per game with the backup getting about 18. The problem with that is figuring out who should occupy those respective roles. There has been a ton of fluctuation over the first month of the season, but with all 3 being fully healthy, it’s time to make some tough decisions.</p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun</h2>
        <p>Alperen Sengun has started the most games out of the 3 so far, but that may be due to the fact that Bruno Fernando has been injured for a majority of the season up to this point. Sengun provides the ability, on offense, to facilitate plays and completely take over games. Everything can be run through him, which is something that sets him apart from the other 2. However, his defense certainly leaves something to be desired. He doesn’t have the pace to keep up with other guards, and couldn’t stay out of foul trouble if his life depended on it. For reference, Sengun averages the 7th most fouls in the league per game out of every single NBA player while only playing about 27 minutes a night.</p>
        <p>I think he has to play though. There’s no world where Sengun is the one left out of the rotation. If that were the case, I think there would be fans rioting outside of Toyota Center. He is the biggest part of our future compared to the other 2, and should be given minutes based on that alone. The former Turkish League MVP has talents that are not easy to replicate by any means, even drawing comparisons to Nikola Jokic in recent times. His court vision is something that simply cannot be taught and certainly shouldn’t be taken for granted. There’s a reason the organization traded away Christian Wood, and at the time it was to open up minutes for Alperen Sengun. That shouldn’t be forgotten only a few months later.</p>
        <h2>Usman Garuba</h2>
        <p>Usman Gaurba didn’t have the rookie season that he may have wanted, but has certainly picked it up in year 2. As a member of the Goon Squad, he has been able to use his energy, tenacity, and defense to really solidify his minutes. It’s fun to watch Garuba lock up the opposing team’s best player or grab an offensive rebound before kicking the ball out to a teammate for an open shot. That being said, he isn’t the greatest on the offensive end from a shot-creating perspective. This is why the prospect from Spain was considered sort of a project pick, when he was taken 23rd in the 2021 NBA draft. We knew his potential and work ethic were both unmatched, but he needed a lot of work on the offensive end to even become useful, which we have yet to see materialize very much.</p>
        <p>If you could somehow merge Sengun’s offensive skill set with Garuba’s defense and rebounding, you would have one of the best players in the league. Unfortunately, that’s not possible and we have to pick between them. They both have strengths and deficiencies in their game, so it’s tough to decide which of their abilities is most valuable. I think Garuba should definitely get some minutes. He was a first round pick just a season ago, and has slowly begun to progress with that opportunity he’s been given. The bench lineup is what usually keeps the Rockets in all of these close games, and the Spaniard is a big part of that.</p>
        <h2>Bruno Fernando</h2>
        <p>Bruno Fernando is the reason for this discussion in the first place. Prior to his contract being agreed upon, it was the consensus that Sengun would be that starter and Garuba would be the backup center. Now that Fernando is part of the equation, everything becomes a lot more complicated. He plays a lot like Clint Capela did in his first few years in the league. Fernando is a lob threat that can run pick-and-roll with either Jalen Green or Kevin Porter Jr. and block shots on the other end of the court. The center has been out of the lineup for some time now, but was the starter for the first games of the season over Alperen Sengun. Now that he’s fully healthy, could it go back to how it was?</p>
        <p>I personally think Fernando is the odd-man out between this group. If you get offense from Sengun and defense from Garuba, that’s pretty much all you need. I could see, though, the argument that Fernando is a better fit alongside Jalen Green compared to the other 2. He’s also at least effective on both ends of the floor, which is something he has over the others. Coach Stephen Silas may opt to even start Fernando on some nights depending on the matchup, but I think that’s a mistake. He’s just not as important to develop, nor does he fit that timeline as well as Sengun and Fernando both do. We may also see a 3-center rotation for some time before any choices are actually made. I just don’t know how effective or sustainable that is for the future.</p>
