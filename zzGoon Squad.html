        <h1>Explaining the Houston Rockets “Goon Squad” Lineup in 2022</h1>
        <p>You may have heard by now of Ryan Hollins’ “Goon Squad” on the Houston Rockets but might not know what it is or anything about it. The Goon Squad is composed of Tari Eason, Kenyon Martin Jr., and Usman Garuba, but Daishen Nix is also considered a possible 4th member. He is included in a majority of the lineups, but it is still up for debate whether or not he is a real part of it. Anyways, Stephen Silas has chosen to have these 3 guys share a lot of their minutes with one another, off the bench. Now that we have a decent sample size, it’s time to look at how well this group has performed.</p>
        <p>All stats referenced can be found using this link: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?slug=advanced&TeamID=1610612745">click me</a></p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Tari Eason, out of LSU, was selected by the Rockets with the 17th overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft, which was acquired from the Brooklyn Nets via the James Harden trade in January of 2021. Usman Garuba played in Spain for several years before being taken in the 23rd slot of the 2021 draft by the organization. He wasn’t given much of an opportunity to prove himself at the NBA level last season, but has begun to find his footing in the lineup. The last member, Kenyon Martin Jr., was chosen by the Kings at #52 in the 2020 draft and traded to the Rockets for an undisclosed return. He had requested a trade last off-season, but seems to have revoked that request and is open to a long-term extension keeping him in Houston.</p>
        <h2>Goon Squad Ideology</h2>
        <p>This Goon Squad often comes in when the starters need a break to provide a new dimension to this Rockets team. They play with high energy, hustle, and provide a spark on both ends of the floor. Paired with Daishen Nix and Jalen Green, the lineup plays at an average pace of 112.60, which is incredibly fast considering the league average pace is at about 100. They are able to keep up at this speed because all the guys are super athletic and under 22 years old. This lineup is also often found diving for loose balls, taking charges, and playing quality defense. It is very common to see this group put together a run and mount a comeback against a superior team. They are a big part of why the Rockets are in a lot of close games.</p>
        <h2>Analyzing Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>Now it’s time to figure out if this lineup has even been effective. The starters currently have a negative net rating, but somehow both of the Goon Squad groups (with Green and KPJ as well as Green and Nix) have a positive one, despite the Rockets having an atrocious record. This may be due to the fact that they typically face off against the opposing team’s bench unit, but it is a promising sign. They also have fantastic rebounding numbers considering that the tallest members, Usman Garuba and Tari Eason, are both only 6’8”, which is small for an NBA center. This stat is just a testament to how well they are at securing the basketball after it bounces off the rim or backboard.</p>
        <p>However, we also have to look at the negatives. First off, the assist-to-turnover ratio is terrible without the starting point guard, Kevin Porter Jr., on the court, and the same goes for their offensive rating. We also don’t have tons of data to prove the consistency of this group. They could just be off to a hot start and will shortly fall back down to earth. Other than that, though, all the other numbers suggest that the “Goon Squad” is regularly outperforming the starters. This goes back to my point earlier about how they bring new life into a blowout game. Not to mention the fact that they play with an energy that makes you want to keep watching.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I like how our coach is continuing to experiment with different players playing together, and has seemingly found something that works. To be honest, this lineup has been the reason the Rockets are bearable to watch when they are down by a huge margin. It feels like at any moment you can look at the scoreboard and the team is right back in it. It’s a shame that Stephen Silas isn’t using this group to close out games and instead we have to watch the starters go out there and commit countless turnovers while losing the matchup. I think it would be interesting to watch what the Goon Squad can do down the stretch, but I doubt we’ll ever see that happen. For now, I count this lineup as an absolute win.</p>
