        <h1>3 Players That Could Have a Bigger Impact Than Expected Next Season</h1>
        <p>As the beginning of the season inches closer, many for-sure things have been established. For example, we know that 4 of the 5 opening day starters are going to be KPJ, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., and Alperen Sengun, as well as that Josh Christopher is going to fill one of the spots off the bench. However, there are still plenty of question marks regarding the rotation. With so many players that deserve minutes, naturally some are going to get them and others are not. This is still a young team that needs to figure out  next year who is going to be a long-term fit.</p>
        <p>This means that there are some players on the roster that could work their way into a bigger role than projected. So many minutes are up for grabs, and below are some of the candidates that could take them. If a player or two goes down with injury, opportunities will open up similarly to what we saw last season when John Wall sat out for the entire year. The Rockets played a total of 30 different players last season, and while I don’t think that number will be that high again, this will still be a team where the lineup will fluctuate on a game-by-game basis. Nobody’s spot is guaranteed, which is why I expect everybody to work as hard as they can to keep their NBA dreams alive.</p>
        <h2>Tari Eason</h2>
        <p>Tari Eason has looked like one of the more polished rookies to come out of the 2022 NBA Draft so far. His determination and skill set will make him a fan-favorite among Rockets’ fans in no time. If Eric Gordon gets traded, the starting small forward position will be up for grabs, and Eason might emerge as a top contender to take it. He plays excellent defense and has the ability to create a bit of offense without the ball in his hands. These young guys are going to need time to learn how to play together, and don’t be surprised if that starts at about the halfway mark this upcoming season.</p>
        <h2>Boban Marjonovic</h2>
        <p>Boban Marjonovic might be the only player that sticks around from the Christian Wood trade, and for good reason. The team could definitely use some size off the bench and he certainly provides that, standing at a height of 7’ 3”. I’m not saying the backup center role belongs to him, but with Usman Garuba’s injury history, I wouldn’t be shocked to see him used more than fans would like. There are some teams that you simply just can’t play small ball against for the full 48 minutes, and Marjonovic looks like the best option the team is going to have to defend against players like Embiid and Jokic. Plus, having a veteran presence on the floor can only help the younger players’ development.</p>
        <h2>Garrison Matthews</h2>
        <p>Last year, Garrison Mattews averaged 26 minutes a game over 65 games, and the only new player that could potentially take some of those minutes away is Tari Eason. I doubt he’ll play as much as he did last season, but the Rockets are still going to need shooters off the bench who can space the floor around Sengun and Usman Garuba. Plus, the organization didn’t give him a 4 year contract to sit on the bench. He’s in kind of an awkward position, being 25 years old, where he’s older than you’d like him to be, but not too old to justify that he shouldn’t play. For better or for worse, at least 1 player is likely to go down with injury next season, and Garry Bird could become the permanent replacement just as we saw last season.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>With only 4 rotation spots realistically open past the 5 starters (Including Eric Gordon) + Josh Christopher, it’s going to be a dog-fight for the remaining minutes. There are about 7 or 8 people I could see filling out the bench unit and I wouldn’t be surprised to see different guys rotate between the G-league and NBA level throughout the season. This is no longer an organization that is desperate to get any young players whatsoever, but one that is going to have to make tough decisions regarding the rotation going forward. It’s hard when the guys you’ve become attached to no longer have a role on the team, but it is a necessary step when completing a rebuild. This is going to be the last season where the Rockets have the freedom of losing games and hopefully it will be used wisely.
