        <h1>Where Could the Rockets End Up In the Standings Next Season Given Their Current Roster?</h1>
        <p>The 2022-2023 NBA season is coming quicker by the minute, and with hopefully an improved roster, where could we see the Rockets fall among other teams? With many organizations around the league moving in new directions, the standings may look vastly different from what we saw this previous year. All of the pressure is on Stephen Silas and the players to finally escape the hole they have found themselves in, this upcoming season. Many fans are eager to see improvement, so it’s best to set some expectations now, in order to accurately gauge what has happened, later down the road.</p>
        <p>Jalen Green is going into year 2, KPJ has now had a full season of experience playing point guard, and the Rockets just added another top prospect in Jabari Smith Jr. All of the signs indicate the team should be at least somewhat better, compared to how they’ve been previously. However, in the NBA, you never really know. Just look at the Lakers from last season. I should probably mention here that all further predictions assume 100% health and no future moves. If I was to factor in those things, we’d be here forever. Changes are gonna happen, and that’s a natural part of this league.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of Western Conference teams that are consensus playoff contenders at this moment, and are currently better than the Rockets will be next season:</p>
        <h4>Warriors</h4>
        <h4>Clippers</h4>
        <h4>Suns</h4>
        <h4>Grizzlies</h4>
        <h4>Nuggets</h4>
        <h4>Mavericks</h4>
        <h4>Timberwolves</h4>
        <p>That leaves the following teams: Pelicans, Kings, Spurs, Thunder, Trailblazers, Jazz, and Lakers. Just writing this now makes me realize how many talented rosters exist in the NBA. If everybody is healthy, the Lakers, Pelicans, Blazers, and Kings are still going to be better than the Rockets for now. So, what does that mean? Realistically, there are 3 teams Rockets have a chance at outperforming next season: the Thunder, Jazz, and Spurs. Each organization’s current situation is outlined below, as well as how they match up, talent-wise against the Houston Rockets.</p>
        <h2>Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
        <p>The Thunder are in a full-on rebuild, just like the Rockets, but have a few players you should watch out for. Josh Giddey is going into year two, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looks to build on his previous success and potentially earn an all-star appearance. Unfortunately, Chet Holmgren, the recent #2 overall pick, is now out for the season. So, that leaves them with a lineup of SGA, Giddey, Luguentz Dort, Darius Bazley, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl. Honestly, the Rockets have a good chance of outperforming them next season. They are super young and might be looking to bottom out again to gain another top prospect.</p>
        <h2>Utah Jazz</h2>
        <p>The Jazz have had a fire sale on pretty much their entire roster this off-season. We know they’ve hit the reset button, but it’s difficult to tell how much worse the team is compared to last year. If their roster remains the same, the Jazz still have a quality starting 5 of Mike Conley, Collin Sexton, Boban Bogdanovic, Lauri Markkanen, and Walker Kessler. However, this is almost certainly going to change between now and the start of the season. If they don’t make any adjustments, I think it’s pretty fair to say they are better than the Rockets. The Jazz just have more combined experience, and proven quality players top to bottom, unlike the Rockets.</p>
        <h2>San Antonio Spurs</h2>
        <p>The Spurs traded Dejounte Murray, their best player, to the Hawks for 3 first round picks, a swap, and Danilo Gallanari this past summer. A team trying to compete would’ve never made that kind of move, so clearly the organization is aiming to be bad next season. Just how bad? We don’t know, but we do know their projected starting lineup is Tre Jones, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, and Jakob Poeltl. That doesn’t seem very impressive to me. There’s a decent chance the Spurs are the worst team in the league come April, and I wouldn’t be shocked to see it. The Rockets should outperform the Spurs, and if they don’t many people will be very disappointed.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So where does this put the Rockets as far as seeding? My best guess for right now is the 12th or 13th seed in the Western Conference. It may not be what fans are hoping for, but the season after next is when they will really make a big jump. We still need to be low enough in the standings to get one more player through the draft before really trying to be competitive. It’s not like I don’t want them to be better now, it’s just that if the Rockets jump the gun too early, we may never win another championship. Just give it some time, and the reward will be worth it. A rebuild doesn’t happen overnight, but hopefully there will be some marginal progress next season that indicates the organization is headed in the right direction.</p>
