        <h1>Setting Expectations For Alperen Sengun Next Season</h1>
        <p>In the 2021 NBA Draft the Rockets acquired the 16th overall pick where they selected former Turkish League MVP, Alperen Sengun. In return, the OKC Thunder received two future firsts via Washington and Detroit from Houston. The organization chose to pounce on the opportunity when they saw him slide down a few spots in the draft and so far, that was the right decision. Many consider this move the steal of the draft based solely on what we saw from Sengun in a limited number of minutes last season. Imagine what he could be now.</p>
        <p>The Rockets have shown that they are committed to his development by shipping off front court players like Christian Wood and Daniel Theis over the last 6 months. Furthermore, Sengun has deservedly been given the starting center title for next season, and the stage couldn’t be more perfectly set for him to have a breakout year. Numerous 3 and D wings have been placed around him like Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason, and Garrison Matthews, which will only further his production. Now is about the time to set some expectations for him next season.</p>
        <p>Sengun’s best attribute by far is his passing. Last season, we saw him throw dimes on a consistent basis that left everyone in shock. Think about what he’ll be able to do with competent shooters around him. This year’s starters are projected to be KPJ, Jalen Green, Eric Gordon, Jabari Smith Jr., and Alperen Sengun. Compare that to last year, when he mostly shared the floor with others like Kenyon Martin Jr., Josh Christopher, Garrison Matthews, and David Nwaba. Like most, his impact will be so much greater when he plays with better players around him.</p>
        <p>Another factor to consider is his development over the offseason. Sengun has been seen working out with all-time center, Hakeem Olajuwon, and is therefore destined to show growth next year. Everything has been put into place for him to succeed and, based on what we have seen so far, I don’t think he will have any trouble doing so. My official predictions are as follows, along with his stats from last season as a reference.</p>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun 2021-2022:</h2>
        <h4>9.6 points, 2.6 assists, 5.5 rebounds, 0.8 steals, and 0.9 blocks in 20.7 minutes per game</h4>
        <h2>Alperen Sengun 2022-2023 (Projected):</h2>
        <h4>18.3 points, 5.7 assists, 8.8 rebounds, 1.1 steals, and 1.8 blocks in 30.3 minutes per game.</h4>
        <p>You may see this as a big jump, which it is, but I believe it is justified because Sengun is being called upon to fill the void left by Christian Wood. Additionally, his shooting percentages are almost certainly going to increase after a full offseason to work on his shot and a natural sophomore leap is to be expected.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that Sengun just turned 20 on July 25th, 2022, and with an extra year of experience the future could be very bright. Being drafted number 16 is a lot of pressure on a then barely 19-year-old kid who had just moved across the world into a new country to play basketball. The adversity he dealt with is hopefully somewhat behind him so that this season he can be even more dedicated to basketball and getting better. </p>
        <p>I don’t expect Sengun to come out of the gate on fire, but rather a slow progression throughout the season. Adjusting to his new role and teammates will come with its own set of challenges, but don’t be surprised when the Rockets go on a big win streak in the second half of the season. He is a crucial part of what the team is building and as it stands, you may be looking at the starting center of a championship contender sooner than you think.</p>
