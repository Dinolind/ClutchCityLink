        <h1>Calculating How Many Games the Rockets Can Realistically Win This Season</h1>
        <p>The 2022-2023 season for the Houston Rockets has not gotten off to the greatest start, to say the least. At a current record of 1-9, many fans are disappointed in the team’s performance. Unfortunately, the Rockets are likely headed towards another year of being absolutely terrible, but the question still remains on exactly how bad they will be. The lineup is not constructed to win now anyways, and with the fact that the Rockets have the 2nd toughest schedule in the league, it could spell disaster. Here are my predictions for exactly how many games the team is going to win this season. </p>
        <h2>Explaining the Situation</h2>
        <p>The organization is currently in a rebuilding phase. Whether you like it or not, that’s just how it is right now. Part of being in a rebuild is losing a ton of games. There are still some optimists saying the Rockets have a shot at the play-in tournament, when in reality that just isn’t going to happen this year. The NBA is really talented as a whole right now, and our roster just doesn’t have the pieces to be competitive in any way, shape, or form. This year just isn’t our year to win games. We all are sick of losing, but it should hopefully be worth it eventually.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, this year’s draft class is absolutely loaded. Headlined by Victor Wembenyama and Scoot Henderson, the Rockets certainly don’t want to miss out on a top prospect. If they want that to happen, sadly, they have to lose a good majority of the games. The NBA may try to discourage tanking in the future, but for now that’s just it works. There will be some big wins, sure, but if you’re going to Toyota Center, don’t expect a win from this team. This is part of the reason why tickets are so cheap compared to a few years ago. That being said, the league runs on a game-by-game basis, giving the Rockets a fighting chance every time they take the floor.</p>
        <h2>Calculating Estimated Total Wins</h2>
        <p>The team has already played 10 games and currently has 1 win and 9 losses. That leaves us with only 72 games left in the season. Of those 72, there are 10 sets of backs-to-backs remaining. A conservative estimate is that the Rockets go either 1-9 or 2-8 on the back end of the back-to-backs. Therefore, we are left with 62 matchups to look at: 29 on the road and 33 at home. If we use the home and road win/loss percentages from last season, and apply them to these numbers, the Rockets are expected to win 6 or 7 games on the road, and 8 or 9 wins at home.</p>
        <p>I’m also going to add 2 wins to both the minimum and maximum expected win totals to account for the fact that the win/loss ratio from last season included back-to-backs, while my numbers do not. If we put everything together, the Rockets are going to win anywhere from 1+1+6+8+2=18 games, to 1+2+7+9+2=21 games. Maybe add a few games to the higher number in hopes of being optimistic, and my prediction is that the 2022-2023 Houston Rockets will win between 18 and 23 games, barring any significant changes to their active roster.</p>
        <h2>What This Means</h2>
        <p>Even if the Rockets win 23 games this season, that would put them with the second worst record in the league, using last season’s standings. This would still ensure very high lottery odds in a class loaded with talent. The Rockets are on pace to only win just over 8 games right now, but that should change. Eventually a win-streak is going to happen, and they’ll get closer to a 20-win pace. This may be a disappointment in some fans’ eyes, and I believe they do have the right to be upset if we are the worst team in the league yet again. However, we are building for the future, and if that means suffering through losses now, then so be it. The Astros have just shown the world why it is beneficial to tank in major sports leagues, and hopefully the Rockets can replicate their timeline in the coming years.
